      "The artist is the creator of beautiful things.  To reveal art and conceal the artist is art's aim.  The critic is he who can translate into another manner or a new material his impression of beautiful things.  The highest as the lowest form of criticism is a mode of autobiography. Those who find ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt without being charming.  This is a fault.  Those who find beautiful meanings in beautiful things are the cultivated.  For these there is hope.  They are the elect to whom beautiful things mean only beauty.  There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book.  Books are well written, or badly written.  That is all.  The nineteenth century dislike of realism is the rage of Caliban seeing his own face in a glass.  The nineteenth century dislike of romanticism is the rage of Caliban not seeing his own face in a glass.  The moral life of man forms part of the subject-matter of the artist, but the morality of art consists in the perfect use of an imperfect medium.  No artist desires to prove anything.  Even things that are true can be proved.  No artist has ethical sympathies.  An ethical sympathy in an artist is an unpardonable mannerism of style.  No artist is ever morbid.  The artist can express everything.  Thought and language are to the artist instruments of an art.  Vice and virtue are to the artist materials for an art.  From the point of view of form, the type of all the arts is the art of the musician.  From the point of view of feeling, the actor's craft is the type.  All art is at once surface and symbol. Those who go beneath the surface do so at their peril.  Those who read the symbol do so at their peril.  It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors.  Diversity of opinion about a work of art shows that the work is new, complex, and vital.  When critics disagree, the artist is in accord with himself.  We can forgive a man for making a useful thing as long as he does not admire it.  The only excuse for making a useless thing is that one admires it intensely.                 All art is quite useless.                              OSCAR WILDE\n"

      "A cold rain began to fall, and the blurred street-lamps looked ghastly in the dripping mist.  The public-houses were just closing, and dim men and women were clustering in broken groups round their doors.  From some of the bars came the sound of horrible laughter.  In others, drunkards brawled and screamed.  Lying back in the hansom, with his hat pulled over his forehead, Dorian Gray watched with listless eyes the sordid shame of the great city, and now and then he repeated to himself the words that Lord Henry had said to him on the first day they had met, \"To cure the soul by means of the senses, and the senses by means of the soul.\"  Yes, that was the secret.  He had often tried it, and would try it again now.  There were opium dens where one could buy oblivion, dens of horror where the memory of old sins could be destroyed by the madness of sins that were new.  The moon hung low in the sky like a yellow skull.  From time to time a huge misshapen cloud stretched a long arm across and hid it.  The gas-lamps grew fewer, and the streets more narrow and gloomy.  Once the man lost his way and had to drive back half a mile.  A steam rose from the horse as it splashed up the puddles.  The sidewindows of the hansom were clogged with a grey-flannel mist.  \"To cure the soul by means of the senses, and the senses by means of the soul!\"  How the words rang in his ears!  His soul, certainly, was sick to death.  Was it true that the senses could cure it?  Innocent blood had been spilled.  What could atone for that?  Ah! for that there was no atonement; but though forgiveness was impossible, forgetfulness was possible still, and he was determined to forget, to stamp the thing out, to crush it as one would crush the adder that had stung one. Indeed, what right had Basil to have spoken to him as he had done?  Who had made him a judge over others?  He had said things that were dreadful, horrible, not to be endured.  On and on plodded the hansom, going slower, it seemed to him, at each step.  He thrust up the trap and called to the man to drive faster. The hideous hunger for opium began to gnaw at him.  His throat burned and his delicate hands twitched nervously together.  He struck at the horse madly with his stick.  The driver laughed and whipped up.  He laughed in answer, and the man was silent.  The way seemed interminable, and the streets like the black web of some sprawling spider.  The monotony became unbearable, and as the mist thickened, he felt afraid.  Then they passed by lonely brickfields.  The fog was lighter here, and he could see the strange, bottle-shaped kilns with their orange, fanlike tongues of fire.  A dog barked as they went by, and far away in the darkness some wandering sea-gull screamed.  The horse stumbled in a rut, then swerved aside and broke into a gallop.  After some time they left the clay road and rattled again over rough-paven streets.  Most of the windows were dark, but now and then fantastic shadows were silhouetted against some lamplit blind.  He watched them curiously.  They moved like monstrous marionettes and made gestures like live things.  He hated them.  A dull rage was in his heart.  As they turned a corner, a woman yelled something at them from an open door, and two men ran after the hansom for about a hundred yards.  The driver beat at them with his whip.  It is said that passion makes one think in a circle.  Certainly with hideous iteration the bitten lips of Dorian Gray shaped and reshaped those subtle words that dealt with soul and sense, till he had found in them the full expression, as it were, of his mood, and justified, by intellectual approval, passions that without such justification would still have dominated his temper.  From cell to cell of his brain crept the one thought; and the wild desire to live, most terrible of all man's appetites, quickened into force each trembling nerve and fibre. Ugliness that had once been hateful to him because it made things real, became dear to him now for that very reason.  Ugliness was the one reality.  The coarse brawl, the loathsome den, the crude violence of disordered life, the very vileness of thief and outcast, were more vivid, in their intense actuality of impression, than all the gracious shapes of art, the dreamy shadows of song.  They were what he needed for forgetfulness.  In three days he would be free.  Suddenly the man drew up with a jerk at the top of a dark lane.  Over the low roofs and jagged chimney-stacks of the houses rose the black masts of ships.  Wreaths of white mist clung like ghostly sails to the yards.  \"Somewhere about here, sir, ain't it?\" he asked huskily through the trap.  Dorian started and peered round.  \"This will do,\" he answered, and having got out hastily and given the driver the extra fare he had promised him, he walked quickly in the direction of the quay.  Here and there a lantern gleamed at the stern of some huge merchantman.  The light shook and splintered in the puddles.  A red glare came from an outward-bound steamer that was coaling.  The slimy pavement looked like a wet mackintosh.  He hurried on towards the left, glancing back now and then to see if he was being followed.  In about seven or eight minutes he reached a small shabby house that was wedged in between two gaunt factories.  In one of the top-windows stood a lamp.  He stopped and gave a peculiar knock.  After a little time he heard steps in the passage and the chain being unhooked.  The door opened quietly, and he went in without saying a word to the squat misshapen figure that flattened itself into the shadow as he passed.  At the end of the hall hung a tattered green curtain that swayed and shook in the gusty wind which had followed him in from the street.  He dragged it aside and entered a long low room which looked as if it had once been a third-rate dancing-saloon. Shrill flaring gas-jets, dulled and distorted in the fly-blown mirrors that faced them, were ranged round the walls.  Greasy reflectors of ribbed tin backed them, making quivering disks of light.  The floor was covered with ochre-coloured sawdust, trampled here and there into mud, and stained with dark rings of spilled liquor.  Some Malays were crouching by a little charcoal stove, playing with bone counters and showing their white teeth as they chattered.  In one corner, with his head buried in his arms, a sailor sprawled over a table, and by the tawdrily painted bar that ran across one complete side stood two haggard women, mocking an old man who was brushing the sleeves of his coat with an expression of disgust.  \"He thinks he's got red ants on him,\" laughed one of them, as Dorian passed by.  The man looked at her in terror and began to whimper.  At the end of the room there was a little staircase, leading to a darkened chamber.  As Dorian hurried up its three rickety steps, the heavy odour of opium met him.  He heaved a deep breath, and his nostrils quivered with pleasure.  When he entered, a young man with smooth yellow hair, who was bending over a lamp lighting a long thin pipe, looked up at him and nodded in a hesitating manner.  \"You here, Adrian?\" muttered Dorian.  \"Where else should I be?\" he answered, listlessly.  \"None of the chaps will speak to me now.\"  \"I thought you had left England.\"  \"Darlington is not going to do anything.  My brother paid the bill at last.  George doesn't speak to me either.... I don't care,\" he added with a sigh.  \"As long as one has this stuff, one doesn't want friends. I think I have had too many friends.\"  Dorian winced and looked round at the grotesque things that lay in such fantastic postures on the ragged mattresses.  The twisted limbs, the gaping mouths, the staring lustreless eyes, fascinated him.  He knew in what strange heavens they were suffering, and what dull hells were teaching them the secret of some new joy.  They were better off than he was.  He was prisoned in thought.  Memory, like a horrible malady, was eating his soul away.  From time to time he seemed to see the eyes of Basil Hallward looking at him.  Yet he felt he could not stay.  The presence of Adrian Singleton troubled him.  He wanted to be where no one would know who he was.  He wanted to escape from himself.  \"I am going on to the other place,\" he said after a pause.  \"On the wharf?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"That mad-cat is sure to be there.  They won't have her in this place now.\"  Dorian shrugged his shoulders.  \"I am sick of women who love one. Women who hate one are much more interesting.  Besides, the stuff is better.\"  \"Much the same.\"  \"I like it better.  Come and have something to drink.  I must have something.\"  \"I don't want anything,\" murmured the young man.  \"Never mind.\"  Adrian Singleton rose up wearily and followed Dorian to the bar.  A half-caste, in a ragged turban and a shabby ulster, grinned a hideous greeting as he thrust a bottle of brandy and two tumblers in front of them.  The women sidled up and began to chatter.  Dorian turned his back on them and said something in a low voice to Adrian Singleton.  A crooked smile, like a Malay crease, writhed across the face of one of the women.  \"We are very proud to-night,\" she sneered.  \"For God's sake don't talk to me,\" cried Dorian, stamping his foot on the ground.  \"What do you want?  Money?  Here it is.  Don't ever talk to me again.\"  Two red sparks flashed for a moment in the woman's sodden eyes, then flickered out and left them dull and glazed.  She tossed her head and raked the coins off the counter with greedy fingers.  Her companion watched her enviously.  \"It's no use,\" sighed Adrian Singleton.  \"I don't care to go back. What does it matter?  I am quite happy here.\"  \"You will write to me if you want anything, won't you?\" said Dorian, after a pause.  \"Perhaps.\"  \"Good night, then.\"  \"Good night,\" answered the young man, passing up the steps and wiping his parched mouth with a handkerchief.  Dorian walked to the door with a look of pain in his face.  As he drew the curtain aside, a hideous laugh broke from the painted lips of the woman who had taken his money.  \"There goes the devil's bargain!\" she hiccoughed, in a hoarse voice.  \"Curse you!\" he answered, \"don't call me that.\"  She snapped her fingers.  \"Prince Charming is what you like to be called, ain't it?\" she yelled after him.  The drowsy sailor leaped to his feet as she spoke, and looked wildly round.  The sound of the shutting of the hall door fell on his ear.  He rushed out as if in pursuit.  Dorian Gray hurried along the quay through the drizzling rain.  His meeting with Adrian Singleton had strangely moved him, and he wondered if the ruin of that young life was really to be laid at his door, as Basil Hallward had said to him with such infamy of insult.  He bit his lip, and for a few seconds his eyes grew sad.  Yet, after all, what did it matter to him?  One's days were too brief to take the burden of another's errors on one's shoulders.  Each man lived his own life and paid his own price for living it.  The only pity was one had to pay so often for a single fault.  One had to pay over and over again, indeed. In her dealings with man, destiny never closed her accounts.  There are moments, psychologists tell us, when the passion for sin, or for what the world calls sin, so dominates a nature that every fibre of the body, as every cell of the brain, seems to be instinct with fearful impulses.  Men and women at such moments lose the freedom of their will.  They move to their terrible end as automatons move.  Choice is taken from them, and conscience is either killed, or, if it lives at all, lives but to give rebellion its fascination and disobedience its charm.  For all sins, as theologians weary not of reminding us, are sins of disobedience.  When that high spirit, that morning star of evil, fell from heaven, it was as a rebel that he fell.  Callous, concentrated on evil, with stained mind, and soul hungry for rebellion, Dorian Gray hastened on, quickening his step as he went, but as he darted aside into a dim archway, that had served him often as a short cut to the ill-famed place where he was going, he felt himself suddenly seized from behind, and before he had time to defend himself, he was thrust back against the wall, with a brutal hand round his throat.  He struggled madly for life, and by a terrible effort wrenched the tightening fingers away.  In a second he heard the click of a revolver, and saw the gleam of a polished barrel, pointing straight at his head, and the dusky form of a short, thick-set man facing him.  \"What do you want?\" he gasped.  \"Keep quiet,\" said the man.  \"If you stir, I shoot you.\"  \"You are mad.  What have I done to you?\"  \"You wrecked the life of Sibyl Vane,\" was the answer, \"and Sibyl Vane was my sister.  She killed herself.  I know it.  Her death is at your door.  I swore I would kill you in return.  For years I have sought you.  I had no clue, no trace.  The two people who could have described you were dead.  I knew nothing of you but the pet name she used to call you.  I heard it to-night by chance.  Make your peace with God, for to-night you are going to die.\"  Dorian Gray grew sick with fear.  \"I never knew her,\" he stammered.  \"I never heard of her.  You are mad.\"  \"You had better confess your sin, for as sure as I am James Vane, you are going to die.\"  There was a horrible moment.  Dorian did not know what to say or do.  \"Down on your knees!\" growled the man.  \"I give you one minute to make your peace--no more.  I go on board to-night for India, and I must do my job first.  One minute.  That's all.\"  Dorian's arms fell to his side.  Paralysed with terror, he did not know what to do.  Suddenly a wild hope flashed across his brain.  \"Stop,\" he cried.  \"How long ago is it since your sister died?  Quick, tell me!\"  \"Eighteen years,\" said the man.  \"Why do you ask me?  What do years matter?\"  \"Eighteen years,\" laughed Dorian Gray, with a touch of triumph in his voice.  \"Eighteen years!  Set me under the lamp and look at my face!\"  James Vane hesitated for a moment, not understanding what was meant. Then he seized Dorian Gray and dragged him from the archway.  Dim and wavering as was the wind-blown light, yet it served to show him the hideous error, as it seemed, into which he had fallen, for the face of the man he had sought to kill had all the bloom of boyhood, all the unstained purity of youth.  He seemed little more than a lad of twenty summers, hardly older, if older indeed at all, than his sister had been when they had parted so many years ago.  It was obvious that this was not the man who had destroyed her life.  He loosened his hold and reeled back.  \"My God! my God!\" he cried, \"and I would have murdered you!\"  Dorian Gray drew a long breath.  \"You have been on the brink of committing a terrible crime, my man,\" he said, looking at him sternly. \"Let this be a warning to you not to take vengeance into your own hands.\"  \"Forgive me, sir,\" muttered James Vane.  \"I was deceived.  A chance word I heard in that damned den set me on the wrong track.\"  \"You had better go home and put that pistol away, or you may get into trouble,\" said Dorian, turning on his heel and going slowly down the street.  James Vane stood on the pavement in horror.  He was trembling from head to foot.  After a little while, a black shadow that had been creeping along the dripping wall moved out into the light and came close to him with stealthy footsteps.  He felt a hand laid on his arm and looked round with a start.  It was one of the women who had been drinking at the bar.  \"Why didn't you kill him?\" she hissed out, putting haggard face quite close to his.  \"I knew you were following him when you rushed out from Daly's. You fool!  You should have killed him.  He has lots of money, and he's as bad as bad.\"  \"He is not the man I am looking for,\" he answered, \"and I want no man's money.  I want a man's life.  The man whose life I want must be nearly forty now.  This one is little more than a boy.  Thank God, I have not got his blood upon my hands.\"  The woman gave a bitter laugh.  \"Little more than a boy!\" she sneered. \"Why, man, it's nigh on eighteen years since Prince Charming made me what I am.\"  \"You lie!\" cried James Vane.  She raised her hand up to heaven.  \"Before God I am telling the truth,\" she cried.  \"Before God?\"  \"Strike me dumb if it ain't so.  He is the worst one that comes here. They say he has sold himself to the devil for a pretty face.  It's nigh on eighteen years since I met him.  He hasn't changed much since then. I have, though,\" she added, with a sickly leer.  \"You swear this?\"  \"I swear it,\" came in hoarse echo from her flat mouth.  \"But don't give me away to him,\" she whined; \"I am afraid of him.  Let me have some money for my night's lodging.\"  He broke from her with an oath and rushed to the corner of the street, but Dorian Gray had disappeared.  When he looked back, the woman had vanished also.\n",

      "At nine o'clock the next morning his servant came in with a cup of chocolate on a tray and opened the shutters.  Dorian was sleeping quite peacefully, lying on his right side, with one hand underneath his cheek.  He looked like a boy who had been tired out with play, or study.  The man had to touch him twice on the shoulder before he woke, and as he opened his eyes a faint smile passed across his lips, as though he had been lost in some delightful dream.  Yet he had not dreamed at all. His night had been untroubled by any images of pleasure or of pain. But youth smiles without any reason.  It is one of its chiefest charms.  He turned round, and leaning upon his elbow, began to sip his chocolate.  The mellow November sun came streaming into the room.  The sky was bright, and there was a genial warmth in the air.  It was almost like a morning in May.  Gradually the events of the preceding night crept with silent, blood-stained feet into his brain and reconstructed themselves there with terrible distinctness.  He winced at the memory of all that he had suffered, and for a moment the same curious feeling of loathing for Basil Hallward that had made him kill him as he sat in the chair came back to him, and he grew cold with passion.  The dead man was still sitting there, too, and in the sunlight now.  How horrible that was! Such hideous things were for the darkness, not for the day.  He felt that if he brooded on what he had gone through he would sicken or grow mad.  There were sins whose fascination was more in the memory than in the doing of them, strange triumphs that gratified the pride more than the passions, and gave to the intellect a quickened sense of joy, greater than any joy they brought, or could ever bring, to the senses.  But this was not one of them.  It was a thing to be driven out of the mind, to be drugged with poppies, to be strangled lest it might strangle one itself.  When the half-hour struck, he passed his hand across his forehead, and then got up hastily and dressed himself with even more than his usual care, giving a good deal of attention to the choice of his necktie and scarf-pin and changing his rings more than once.  He spent a long time also over breakfast, tasting the various dishes, talking to his valet about some new liveries that he was thinking of getting made for the servants at Selby, and going through his correspondence.  At some of the letters, he smiled.  Three of them bored him.  One he read several times over and then tore up with a slight look of annoyance in his face.  \"That awful thing, a woman's memory!\" as Lord Henry had once said.  After he had drunk his cup of black coffee, he wiped his lips slowly with a napkin, motioned to his servant to wait, and going over to the table, sat down and wrote two letters.  One he put in his pocket, the other he handed to the valet.  \"Take this round to 152, Hertford Street, Francis, and if Mr. Campbell is out of town, get his address.\"  As soon as he was alone, he lit a cigarette and began sketching upon a piece of paper, drawing first flowers and bits of architecture, and then human faces.  Suddenly he remarked that every face that he drew seemed to have a fantastic likeness to Basil Hallward.  He frowned, and getting up, went over to the book-case and took out a volume at hazard. He was determined that he would not think about what had happened until it became absolutely necessary that he should do so.  When he had stretched himself on the sofa, he looked at the title-page of the book.  It was Gautier's Emaux et Camees, Charpentier's Japanese-paper edition, with the Jacquemart etching.  The binding was of citron-green leather, with a design of gilt trellis-work and dotted pomegranates.  It had been given to him by Adrian Singleton.  As he turned over the pages, his eye fell on the poem about the hand of Lacenaire, the cold yellow hand \"_du supplice encore mal lavee_,\" with its downy red hairs and its \"_doigts de faune_.\"  He glanced at his own white taper fingers, shuddering slightly in spite of himself, and passed on, till he came to those lovely stanzas upon Venice:       Sur une gamme chromatique,        Le sein de perles ruisselant,      La Venus de l'Adriatique        Sort de l'eau son corps rose et blanc.       Les domes, sur l'azur des ondes        Suivant la phrase au pur contour,      S'enflent comme des gorges rondes        Que souleve un soupir d'amour.       L'esquif aborde et me depose,        Jetant son amarre au pilier,      Devant une facade rose,        Sur le marbre d'un escalier.   How exquisite they were!  As one read them, one seemed to be floating down the green water-ways of the pink and pearl city, seated in a black gondola with silver prow and trailing curtains.  The mere lines looked to him like those straight lines of turquoise-blue that follow one as one pushes out to the Lido.  The sudden flashes of colour reminded him of the gleam of the opal-and-iris-throated birds that flutter round the tall honeycombed Campanile, or stalk, with such stately grace, through the dim, dust-stained arcades.  Leaning back with half-closed eyes, he kept saying over and over to himself:       \"Devant une facade rose,         Sur le marbre d'un escalier.\"  The whole of Venice was in those two lines.  He remembered the autumn that he had passed there, and a wonderful love that had stirred him to mad delightful follies.  There was romance in every place.  But Venice, like Oxford, had kept the background for romance, and, to the true romantic, background was everything, or almost everything.  Basil had been with him part of the time, and had gone wild over Tintoret.  Poor Basil!  What a horrible way for a man to die!  He sighed, and took up the volume again, and tried to forget.  He read of the swallows that fly in and out of the little _cafe_ at Smyrna where the Hadjis sit counting their amber beads and the turbaned merchants smoke their long tasselled pipes and talk gravely to each other; he read of the Obelisk in the Place de la Concorde that weeps tears of granite in its lonely sunless exile and longs to be back by the hot, lotus-covered Nile, where there are Sphinxes, and rose-red ibises, and white vultures with gilded claws, and crocodiles with small beryl eyes that crawl over the green steaming mud; he began to brood over those verses which, drawing music from kiss-stained marble, tell of that curious statue that Gautier compares to a contralto voice, the \"_monstre charmant_\" that couches in the porphyry-room of the Louvre.  But after a time the book fell from his hand.  He grew nervous, and a horrible fit of terror came over him.  What if Alan Campbell should be out of England?  Days would elapse before he could come back.  Perhaps he might refuse to come.  What could he do then?  Every moment was of vital importance.  They had been great friends once, five years before--almost inseparable, indeed.  Then the intimacy had come suddenly to an end. When they met in society now, it was only Dorian Gray who smiled:  Alan Campbell never did.  He was an extremely clever young man, though he had no real appreciation of the visible arts, and whatever little sense of the beauty of poetry he possessed he had gained entirely from Dorian.  His dominant intellectual passion was for science.  At Cambridge he had spent a great deal of his time working in the laboratory, and had taken a good class in the Natural Science Tripos of his year.  Indeed, he was still devoted to the study of chemistry, and had a laboratory of his own in which he used to shut himself up all day long, greatly to the annoyance of his mother, who had set her heart on his standing for Parliament and had a vague idea that a chemist was a person who made up prescriptions.  He was an excellent musician, however, as well, and played both the violin and the piano better than most amateurs.  In fact, it was music that had first brought him and Dorian Gray together--music and that indefinable attraction that Dorian seemed to be able to exercise whenever he wished--and, indeed, exercised often without being conscious of it.  They had met at Lady Berkshire's the night that Rubinstein played there, and after that used to be always seen together at the opera and wherever good music was going on.  For eighteen months their intimacy lasted.  Campbell was always either at Selby Royal or in Grosvenor Square.  To him, as to many others, Dorian Gray was the type of everything that is wonderful and fascinating in life.  Whether or not a quarrel had taken place between them no one ever knew.  But suddenly people remarked that they scarcely spoke when they met and that Campbell seemed always to go away early from any party at which Dorian Gray was present.  He had changed, too--was strangely melancholy at times, appeared almost to dislike hearing music, and would never himself play, giving as his excuse, when he was called upon, that he was so absorbed in science that he had no time left in which to practise.  And this was certainly true.  Every day he seemed to become more interested in biology, and his name appeared once or twice in some of the scientific reviews in connection with certain curious experiments.  This was the man Dorian Gray was waiting for.  Every second he kept glancing at the clock.  As the minutes went by he became horribly agitated.  At last he got up and began to pace up and down the room, looking like a beautiful caged thing.  He took long stealthy strides. His hands were curiously cold.  The suspense became unbearable.  Time seemed to him to be crawling with feet of lead, while he by monstrous winds was being swept towards the jagged edge of some black cleft of precipice.  He knew what was waiting for him there; saw it, indeed, and, shuddering, crushed with dank hands his burning lids as though he would have robbed the very brain of sight and driven the eyeballs back into their cave.  It was useless.  The brain had its own food on which it battened, and the imagination, made grotesque by terror, twisted and distorted as a living thing by pain, danced like some foul puppet on a stand and grinned through moving masks.  Then, suddenly, time stopped for him.  Yes:  that blind, slow-breathing thing crawled no more, and horrible thoughts, time being dead, raced nimbly on in front, and dragged a hideous future from its grave, and showed it to him.  He stared at it.  Its very horror made him stone.  At last the door opened and his servant entered.  He turned glazed eyes upon him.  \"Mr. Campbell, sir,\" said the man.  A sigh of relief broke from his parched lips, and the colour came back to his cheeks.  \"Ask him to come in at once, Francis.\"  He felt that he was himself again.  His mood of cowardice had passed away.  The man bowed and retired.  In a few moments, Alan Campbell walked in, looking very stern and rather pale, his pallor being intensified by his coal-black hair and dark eyebrows.  \"Alan!  This is kind of you.  I thank you for coming.\"  \"I had intended never to enter your house again, Gray.  But you said it was a matter of life and death.\"  His voice was hard and cold.  He spoke with slow deliberation.  There was a look of contempt in the steady searching gaze that he turned on Dorian.  He kept his hands in the pockets of his Astrakhan coat, and seemed not to have noticed the gesture with which he had been greeted.  \"Yes:  it is a matter of life and death, Alan, and to more than one person.  Sit down.\"  Campbell took a chair by the table, and Dorian sat opposite to him. The two men's eyes met.  In Dorian's there was infinite pity.  He knew that what he was going to do was dreadful.  After a strained moment of silence, he leaned across and said, very quietly, but watching the effect of each word upon the face of him he had sent for, \"Alan, in a locked room at the top of this house, a room to which nobody but myself has access, a dead man is seated at a table. He has been dead ten hours now.  Don't stir, and don't look at me like that.  Who the man is, why he died, how he died, are matters that do not concern you.  What you have to do is this--\"  \"Stop, Gray.  I don't want to know anything further.  Whether what you have told me is true or not true doesn't concern me.  I entirely decline to be mixed up in your life.  Keep your horrible secrets to yourself.  They don't interest me any more.\"  \"Alan, they will have to interest you.  This one will have to interest you.  I am awfully sorry for you, Alan.  But I can't help myself.  You are the one man who is able to save me.  I am forced to bring you into the matter.  I have no option.  Alan, you are scientific.  You know about chemistry and things of that kind.  You have made experiments. What you have got to do is to destroy the thing that is upstairs--to destroy it so that not a vestige of it will be left.  Nobody saw this person come into the house.  Indeed, at the present moment he is supposed to be in Paris.  He will not be missed for months.  When he is missed, there must be no trace of him found here.  You, Alan, you must change him, and everything that belongs to him, into a handful of ashes that I may scatter in the air.\"  \"You are mad, Dorian.\"  \"Ah!  I was waiting for you to call me Dorian.\"  \"You are mad, I tell you--mad to imagine that I would raise a finger to help you, mad to make this monstrous confession.  I will have nothing to do with this matter, whatever it is.  Do you think I am going to peril my reputation for you?  What is it to me what devil's work you are up to?\"  \"It was suicide, Alan.\"  \"I am glad of that.  But who drove him to it?  You, I should fancy.\"  \"Do you still refuse to do this for me?\"  \"Of course I refuse.  I will have absolutely nothing to do with it.  I don't care what shame comes on you.  You deserve it all.  I should not be sorry to see you disgraced, publicly disgraced.  How dare you ask me, of all men in the world, to mix myself up in this horror?  I should have thought you knew more about people's characters.  Your friend Lord Henry Wotton can't have taught you much about psychology, whatever else he has taught you.  Nothing will induce me to stir a step to help you. You have come to the wrong man.  Go to some of your friends.  Don't come to me.\"  \"Alan, it was murder.  I killed him.  You don't know what he had made me suffer.  Whatever my life is, he had more to do with the making or the marring of it than poor Harry has had.  He may not have intended it, the result was the same.\"  \"Murder!  Good God, Dorian, is that what you have come to?  I shall not inform upon you.  It is not my business.  Besides, without my stirring in the matter, you are certain to be arrested.  Nobody ever commits a crime without doing something stupid.  But I will have nothing to do with it.\"  \"You must have something to do with it.  Wait, wait a moment; listen to me.  Only listen, Alan.  All I ask of you is to perform a certain scientific experiment.  You go to hospitals and dead-houses, and the horrors that you do there don't affect you.  If in some hideous dissecting-room or fetid laboratory you found this man lying on a leaden table with red gutters scooped out in it for the blood to flow through, you would simply look upon him as an admirable subject.  You would not turn a hair.  You would not believe that you were doing anything wrong.  On the contrary, you would probably feel that you were benefiting the human race, or increasing the sum of knowledge in the world, or gratifying intellectual curiosity, or something of that kind. What I want you to do is merely what you have often done before. Indeed, to destroy a body must be far less horrible than what you are accustomed to work at.  And, remember, it is the only piece of evidence against me.  If it is discovered, I am lost; and it is sure to be discovered unless you help me.\"  \"I have no desire to help you.  You forget that.  I am simply indifferent to the whole thing.  It has nothing to do with me.\"  \"Alan, I entreat you.  Think of the position I am in.  Just before you came I almost fainted with terror.  You may know terror yourself some day.  No! don't think of that.  Look at the matter purely from the scientific point of view.  You don't inquire where the dead things on which you experiment come from.  Don't inquire now.  I have told you too much as it is.  But I beg of you to do this.  We were friends once, Alan.\"  \"Don't speak about those days, Dorian--they are dead.\"  \"The dead linger sometimes.  The man upstairs will not go away.  He is sitting at the table with bowed head and outstretched arms.  Alan! Alan!  If you don't come to my assistance, I am ruined.  Why, they will hang me, Alan!  Don't you understand?  They will hang me for what I have done.\"  \"There is no good in prolonging this scene.  I absolutely refuse to do anything in the matter.  It is insane of you to ask me.\"  \"You refuse?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"I entreat you, Alan.\"  \"It is useless.\"  The same look of pity came into Dorian Gray's eyes.  Then he stretched out his hand, took a piece of paper, and wrote something on it.  He read it over twice, folded it carefully, and pushed it across the table.  Having done this, he got up and went over to the window.  Campbell looked at him in surprise, and then took up the paper, and opened it.  As he read it, his face became ghastly pale and he fell back in his chair.  A horrible sense of sickness came over him.  He felt as if his heart was beating itself to death in some empty hollow.  After two or three minutes of terrible silence, Dorian turned round and came and stood behind him, putting his hand upon his shoulder.  \"I am so sorry for you, Alan,\" he murmured, \"but you leave me no alternative.  I have a letter written already.  Here it is.  You see the address.  If you don't help me, I must send it.  If you don't help me, I will send it.  You know what the result will be.  But you are going to help me.  It is impossible for you to refuse now.  I tried to spare you.  You will do me the justice to admit that.  You were stern, harsh, offensive.  You treated me as no man has ever dared to treat me--no living man, at any rate.  I bore it all.  Now it is for me to dictate terms.\"  Campbell buried his face in his hands, and a shudder passed through him.  \"Yes, it is my turn to dictate terms, Alan.  You know what they are. The thing is quite simple.  Come, don't work yourself into this fever. The thing has to be done.  Face it, and do it.\"  A groan broke from Campbell's lips and he shivered all over.  The ticking of the clock on the mantelpiece seemed to him to be dividing time into separate atoms of agony, each of which was too terrible to be borne.  He felt as if an iron ring was being slowly tightened round his forehead, as if the disgrace with which he was threatened had already come upon him.  The hand upon his shoulder weighed like a hand of lead. It was intolerable.  It seemed to crush him.  \"Come, Alan, you must decide at once.\"  \"I cannot do it,\" he said, mechanically, as though words could alter things.  \"You must.  You have no choice.  Don't delay.\"  He hesitated a moment.  \"Is there a fire in the room upstairs?\"  \"Yes, there is a gas-fire with asbestos.\"  \"I shall have to go home and get some things from the laboratory.\"  \"No, Alan, you must not leave the house.  Write out on a sheet of notepaper what you want and my servant will take a cab and bring the things back to you.\"  Campbell scrawled a few lines, blotted them, and addressed an envelope to his assistant.  Dorian took the note up and read it carefully.  Then he rang the bell and gave it to his valet, with orders to return as soon as possible and to bring the things with him.  As the hall door shut, Campbell started nervously, and having got up from the chair, went over to the chimney-piece. He was shivering with a kind of ague.  For nearly twenty minutes, neither of the men spoke.  A fly buzzed noisily about the room, and the ticking of the clock was like the beat of a hammer.  As the chime struck one, Campbell turned round, and looking at Dorian Gray, saw that his eyes were filled with tears.  There was something in the purity and refinement of that sad face that seemed to enrage him. \"You are infamous, absolutely infamous!\" he muttered.  \"Hush, Alan.  You have saved my life,\" said Dorian.  \"Your life?  Good heavens! what a life that is!  You have gone from corruption to corruption, and now you have culminated in crime.  In doing what I am going to do--what you force me to do--it is not of your life that I am thinking.\"  \"Ah, Alan,\" murmured Dorian with a sigh, \"I wish you had a thousandth part of the pity for me that I have for you.\" He turned away as he spoke and stood looking out at the garden.  Campbell made no answer.  After about ten minutes a knock came to the door, and the servant entered, carrying a large mahogany chest of chemicals, with a long coil of steel and platinum wire and two rather curiously shaped iron clamps.  \"Shall I leave the things here, sir?\" he asked Campbell.  \"Yes,\" said Dorian.  \"And I am afraid, Francis, that I have another errand for you.  What is the name of the man at Richmond who supplies Selby with orchids?\"  \"Harden, sir.\"  \"Yes--Harden.  You must go down to Richmond at once, see Harden personally, and tell him to send twice as many orchids as I ordered, and to have as few white ones as possible.  In fact, I don't want any white ones.  It is a lovely day, Francis, and Richmond is a very pretty place--otherwise I wouldn't bother you about it.\"  \"No trouble, sir.  At what time shall I be back?\"  Dorian looked at Campbell.  \"How long will your experiment take, Alan?\" he said in a calm indifferent voice.  The presence of a third person in the room seemed to give him extraordinary courage.  Campbell frowned and bit his lip.  \"It will take about five hours,\" he answered.  \"It will be time enough, then, if you are back at half-past seven, Francis.  Or stay:  just leave my things out for dressing.  You can have the evening to yourself.  I am not dining at home, so I shall not want you.\"  \"Thank you, sir,\" said the man, leaving the room.  \"Now, Alan, there is not a moment to be lost.  How heavy this chest is! I'll take it for you.  You bring the other things.\"  He spoke rapidly and in an authoritative manner.  Campbell felt dominated by him.  They left the room together.  When they reached the top landing, Dorian took out the key and turned it in the lock.  Then he stopped, and a troubled look came into his eyes.  He shuddered.  \"I don't think I can go in, Alan,\" he murmured.  \"It is nothing to me.  I don't require you,\" said Campbell coldly.  Dorian half opened the door.  As he did so, he saw the face of his portrait leering in the sunlight.  On the floor in front of it the torn curtain was lying.  He remembered that the night before he had forgotten, for the first time in his life, to hide the fatal canvas, and was about to rush forward, when he drew back with a shudder.  What was that loathsome red dew that gleamed, wet and glistening, on one of the hands, as though the canvas had sweated blood?  How horrible it was!--more horrible, it seemed to him for the moment, than the silent thing that he knew was stretched across the table, the thing whose grotesque misshapen shadow on the spotted carpet showed him that it had not stirred, but was still there, as he had left it.  He heaved a deep breath, opened the door a little wider, and with half-closed eyes and averted head, walked quickly in, determined that he would not look even once upon the dead man.  Then, stooping down and taking up the gold-and-purple hanging, he flung it right over the picture.  There he stopped, feeling afraid to turn round, and his eyes fixed themselves on the intricacies of the pattern before him.  He heard Campbell bringing in the heavy chest, and the irons, and the other things that he had required for his dreadful work.  He began to wonder if he and Basil Hallward had ever met, and, if so, what they had thought of each other.  \"Leave me now,\" said a stern voice behind him.  He turned and hurried out, just conscious that the dead man had been thrust back into the chair and that Campbell was gazing into a glistening yellow face.  As he was going downstairs, he heard the key being turned in the lock.  It was long after seven when Campbell came back into the library.  He was pale, but absolutely calm.  \"I have done what you asked me to do,\" he muttered. \"And now, good-bye. Let us never see each other again.\"  \"You have saved me from ruin, Alan.  I cannot forget that,\" said Dorian simply.  As soon as Campbell had left, he went upstairs.  There was a horrible smell of nitric acid in the room.  But the thing that had been sitting at the table was gone.\n",

      "The artist is the creator of beautiful things.  To reveal art and conceal the artist is art's aim.  The critic is he who can translate into another manner or a new material his impression of beautiful things.  The highest as the lowest form of criticism is a mode of autobiography. Those who find ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt without being charming.  This is a fault.  Those who find beautiful meanings in beautiful things are the cultivated.  For these there is hope.  They are the elect to whom beautiful things mean only beauty.  There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book.  Books are well written, or badly written.  That is all.  The nineteenth century dislike of realism is the rage of Caliban seeing his own face in a glass.  The nineteenth century dislike of romanticism is the rage of Caliban not seeing his own face in a glass.  The moral life of man forms part of the subject-matter of the artist, but the morality of art consists in the perfect use of an imperfect medium.  No artist desires to prove anything.  Even things that are true can be proved.  No artist has ethical sympathies.  An ethical sympathy in an artist is an unpardonable mannerism of style.  No artist is ever morbid.  The artist can express everything.  Thought and language are to the artist instruments of an art.  Vice and virtue are to the artist materials for an art.  From the point of view of form, the type of all the arts is the art of the musician.  From the point of view of feeling, the actor's craft is the type.  All art is at once surface and symbol. Those who go beneath the surface do so at their peril.  Those who read the symbol do so at their peril.  It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors.  Diversity of opinion about a work of art shows that the work is new, complex, and vital.  When critics disagree, the artist is in accord with himself.  We can forgive a man for making a useful thing as long as he does not admire it.  The only excuse for making a useless thing is that one admires it intensely.                 All art is quite useless.                              OSCAR WILDE\n",

      "At half-past twelve next day Lord Henry Wotton strolled from Curzon Street over to the Albany to call on his uncle, Lord Fermor, a genial if somewhat rough-mannered old bachelor, whom the outside world called selfish because it derived no particular benefit from him, but who was considered generous by Society as he fed the people who amused him. His father had been our ambassador at Madrid when Isabella was young and Prim unthought of, but had retired from the diplomatic service in a capricious moment of annoyance on not being offered the Embassy at Paris, a post to which he considered that he was fully entitled by reason of his birth, his indolence, the good English of his dispatches, and his inordinate passion for pleasure.  The son, who had been his father's secretary, had resigned along with his chief, somewhat foolishly as was thought at the time, and on succeeding some months later to the title, had set himself to the serious study of the great aristocratic art of doing absolutely nothing.  He had two large town houses, but preferred to live in chambers as it was less trouble, and took most of his meals at his club.  He paid some attention to the management of his collieries in the Midland counties, excusing himself for this taint of industry on the ground that the one advantage of having coal was that it enabled a gentleman to afford the decency of burning wood on his own hearth.  In politics he was a Tory, except when the Tories were in office, during which period he roundly abused them for being a pack of Radicals.  He was a hero to his valet, who bullied him, and a terror to most of his relations, whom he bullied in turn. Only England could have produced him, and he always said that the country was going to the dogs.  His principles were out of date, but there was a good deal to be said for his prejudices.  When Lord Henry entered the room, he found his uncle sitting in a rough shooting-coat, smoking a cheroot and grumbling over _The Times_.  \"Well, Harry,\" said the old gentleman, \"what brings you out so early?  I thought you dandies never got up till two, and were not visible till five.\"  \"Pure family affection, I assure you, Uncle George.  I want to get something out of you.\"  \"Money, I suppose,\" said Lord Fermor, making a wry face.  \"Well, sit down and tell me all about it.  Young people, nowadays, imagine that money is everything.\"  \"Yes,\" murmured Lord Henry, settling his button-hole in his coat; \"and when they grow older they know it.  But I don't want money.  It is only people who pay their bills who want that, Uncle George, and I never pay mine.  Credit is the capital of a younger son, and one lives charmingly upon it.  Besides, I always deal with Dartmoor's tradesmen, and consequently they never bother me.  What I want is information:  not useful information, of course; useless information.\"  \"Well, I can tell you anything that is in an English Blue Book, Harry, although those fellows nowadays write a lot of nonsense.  When I was in the Diplomatic, things were much better.  But I hear they let them in now by examination.  What can you expect?  Examinations, sir, are pure humbug from beginning to end.  If a man is a gentleman, he knows quite enough, and if he is not a gentleman, whatever he knows is bad for him.\"  \"Mr. Dorian Gray does not belong to Blue Books, Uncle George,\" said Lord Henry languidly.  \"Mr. Dorian Gray?  Who is he?\" asked Lord Fermor, knitting his bushy white eyebrows.  \"That is what I have come to learn, Uncle George.  Or rather, I know who he is.  He is the last Lord Kelso's grandson.  His mother was a Devereux, Lady Margaret Devereux.  I want you to tell me about his mother.  What was she like?  Whom did she marry?  You have known nearly everybody in your time, so you might have known her.  I am very much interested in Mr. Gray at present.  I have only just met him.\"  \"Kelso's grandson!\" echoed the old gentleman.  \"Kelso's grandson! ... Of course.... I knew his mother intimately.  I believe I was at her christening.  She was an extraordinarily beautiful girl, Margaret Devereux, and made all the men frantic by running away with a penniless young fellow--a mere nobody, sir, a subaltern in a foot regiment, or something of that kind.  Certainly.  I remember the whole thing as if it happened yesterday.  The poor chap was killed in a duel at Spa a few months after the marriage.  There was an ugly story about it.  They said Kelso got some rascally adventurer, some Belgian brute, to insult his son-in-law in public--paid him, sir, to do it, paid him--and that the fellow spitted his man as if he had been a pigeon.  The thing was hushed up, but, egad, Kelso ate his chop alone at the club for some time afterwards.  He brought his daughter back with him, I was told, and she never spoke to him again.  Oh, yes; it was a bad business.  The girl died, too, died within a year.  So she left a son, did she?  I had forgotten that.  What sort of boy is he?  If he is like his mother, he must be a good-looking chap.\"  \"He is very good-looking,\" assented Lord Henry.  \"I hope he will fall into proper hands,\" continued the old man.  \"He should have a pot of money waiting for him if Kelso did the right thing by him.  His mother had money, too.  All the Selby property came to her, through her grandfather.  Her grandfather hated Kelso, thought him a mean dog.  He was, too.  Came to Madrid once when I was there.  Egad, I was ashamed of him.  The Queen used to ask me about the English noble who was always quarrelling with the cabmen about their fares.  They made quite a story of it.  I didn't dare show my face at Court for a month.  I hope he treated his grandson better than he did the jarvies.\"  \"I don't know,\" answered Lord Henry.  \"I fancy that the boy will be well off.  He is not of age yet.  He has Selby, I know.  He told me so. And ... his mother was very beautiful?\"  \"Margaret Devereux was one of the loveliest creatures I ever saw, Harry.  What on earth induced her to behave as she did, I never could understand.  She could have married anybody she chose.  Carlington was mad after her.  She was romantic, though.  All the women of that family were.  The men were a poor lot, but, egad! the women were wonderful. Carlington went on his knees to her.  Told me so himself.  She laughed at him, and there wasn't a girl in London at the time who wasn't after him.  And by the way, Harry, talking about silly marriages, what is this humbug your father tells me about Dartmoor wanting to marry an American?  Ain't English girls good enough for him?\"  \"It is rather fashionable to marry Americans just now, Uncle George.\"  \"I'll back English women against the world, Harry,\" said Lord Fermor, striking the table with his fist.  \"The betting is on the Americans.\"  \"They don't last, I am told,\" muttered his uncle.  \"A long engagement exhausts them, but they are capital at a steeplechase.  They take things flying.  I don't think Dartmoor has a chance.\"  \"Who are her people?\" grumbled the old gentleman.  \"Has she got any?\"  Lord Henry shook his head.  \"American girls are as clever at concealing their parents, as English women are at concealing their past,\" he said, rising to go.  \"They are pork-packers, I suppose?\"  \"I hope so, Uncle George, for Dartmoor's sake.  I am told that pork-packing is the most lucrative profession in America, after politics.\"  \"Is she pretty?\"  \"She behaves as if she was beautiful.  Most American women do.  It is the secret of their charm.\"  \"Why can't these American women stay in their own country?  They are always telling us that it is the paradise for women.\"  \"It is.  That is the reason why, like Eve, they are so excessively anxious to get out of it,\" said Lord Henry.  \"Good-bye, Uncle George. I shall be late for lunch, if I stop any longer.  Thanks for giving me the information I wanted.  I always like to know everything about my new friends, and nothing about my old ones.\"  \"Where are you lunching, Harry?\"  \"At Aunt Agatha's. I have asked myself and Mr. Gray.  He is her latest _protege_.\"  \"Humph! tell your Aunt Agatha, Harry, not to bother me any more with her charity appeals.  I am sick of them.  Why, the good woman thinks that I have nothing to do but to write cheques for her silly fads.\"  \"All right, Uncle George, I'll tell her, but it won't have any effect. Philanthropic people lose all sense of humanity.  It is their distinguishing characteristic.\"  The old gentleman growled approvingly and rang the bell for his servant.  Lord Henry passed up the low arcade into Burlington Street and turned his steps in the direction of Berkeley Square.  So that was the story of Dorian Gray's parentage.  Crudely as it had been told to him, it had yet stirred him by its suggestion of a strange, almost modern romance.  A beautiful woman risking everything for a mad passion.  A few wild weeks of happiness cut short by a hideous, treacherous crime.  Months of voiceless agony, and then a child born in pain.  The mother snatched away by death, the boy left to solitude and the tyranny of an old and loveless man.  Yes; it was an interesting background.  It posed the lad, made him more perfect, as it were.  Behind every exquisite thing that existed, there was something tragic.  Worlds had to be in travail, that the meanest flower might blow.... And how charming he had been at dinner the night before, as with startled eyes and lips parted in frightened pleasure he had sat opposite to him at the club, the red candleshades staining to a richer rose the wakening wonder of his face.  Talking to him was like playing upon an exquisite violin.  He answered to every touch and thrill of the bow.... There was something terribly enthralling in the exercise of influence.  No other activity was like it.  To project one's soul into some gracious form, and let it tarry there for a moment; to hear one's own intellectual views echoed back to one with all the added music of passion and youth; to convey one's temperament into another as though it were a subtle fluid or a strange perfume: there was a real joy in that--perhaps the most satisfying joy left to us in an age so limited and vulgar as our own, an age grossly carnal in its pleasures, and grossly common in its aims.... He was a marvellous type, too, this lad, whom by so curious a chance he had met in Basil's studio, or could be fashioned into a marvellous type, at any rate.  Grace was his, and the white purity of boyhood, and beauty such as old Greek marbles kept for us.  There was nothing that one could not do with him.  He could be made a Titan or a toy.  What a pity it was that such beauty was destined to fade! ...  And Basil?  From a psychological point of view, how interesting he was!  The new manner in art, the fresh mode of looking at life, suggested so strangely by the merely visible presence of one who was unconscious of it all; the silent spirit that dwelt in dim woodland, and walked unseen in open field, suddenly showing herself, Dryadlike and not afraid, because in his soul who sought for her there had been wakened that wonderful vision to which alone are wonderful things revealed; the mere shapes and patterns of things becoming, as it were, refined, and gaining a kind of symbolical value, as though they were themselves patterns of some other and more perfect form whose shadow they made real:  how strange it all was!  He remembered something like it in history.  Was it not Plato, that artist in thought, who had first analyzed it?  Was it not Buonarotti who had carved it in the coloured marbles of a sonnet-sequence? But in our own century it was strange.... Yes; he would try to be to Dorian Gray what, without knowing it, the lad was to the painter who had fashioned the wonderful portrait.  He would seek to dominate him--had already, indeed, half done so.  He would make that wonderful spirit his own. There was something fascinating in this son of love and death.  Suddenly he stopped and glanced up at the houses.  He found that he had passed his aunt's some distance, and, smiling to himself, turned back. When he entered the somewhat sombre hall, the butler told him that they had gone in to lunch.  He gave one of the footmen his hat and stick and passed into the dining-room.  \"Late as usual, Harry,\" cried his aunt, shaking her head at him.  He invented a facile excuse, and having taken the vacant seat next to her, looked round to see who was there.  Dorian bowed to him shyly from the end of the table, a flush of pleasure stealing into his cheek. Opposite was the Duchess of Harley, a lady of admirable good-nature and good temper, much liked by every one who knew her, and of those ample architectural proportions that in women who are not duchesses are described by contemporary historians as stoutness.  Next to her sat, on her right, Sir Thomas Burdon, a Radical member of Parliament, who followed his leader in public life and in private life followed the best cooks, dining with the Tories and thinking with the Liberals, in accordance with a wise and well-known rule.  The post on her left was occupied by Mr. Erskine of Treadley, an old gentleman of considerable charm and culture, who had fallen, however, into bad habits of silence, having, as he explained once to Lady Agatha, said everything that he had to say before he was thirty.  His own neighbour was Mrs. Vandeleur, one of his aunt's oldest friends, a perfect saint amongst women, but so dreadfully dowdy that she reminded one of a badly bound hymn-book. Fortunately for him she had on the other side Lord Faudel, a most intelligent middle-aged mediocrity, as bald as a ministerial statement in the House of Commons, with whom she was conversing in that intensely earnest manner which is the one unpardonable error, as he remarked once himself, that all really good people fall into, and from which none of them ever quite escape.  \"We are talking about poor Dartmoor, Lord Henry,\" cried the duchess, nodding pleasantly to him across the table.  \"Do you think he will really marry this fascinating young person?\"  \"I believe she has made up her mind to propose to him, Duchess.\"  \"How dreadful!\" exclaimed Lady Agatha.  \"Really, some one should interfere.\"  \"I am told, on excellent authority, that her father keeps an American dry-goods store,\" said Sir Thomas Burdon, looking supercilious.  \"My uncle has already suggested pork-packing, Sir Thomas.\"  \"Dry-goods! What are American dry-goods?\" asked the duchess, raising her large hands in wonder and accentuating the verb.  \"American novels,\" answered Lord Henry, helping himself to some quail.  The duchess looked puzzled.  \"Don't mind him, my dear,\" whispered Lady Agatha.  \"He never means anything that he says.\"  \"When America was discovered,\" said the Radical member--and he began to give some wearisome facts.  Like all people who try to exhaust a subject, he exhausted his listeners.  The duchess sighed and exercised her privilege of interruption.  \"I wish to goodness it never had been discovered at all!\" she exclaimed.  \"Really, our girls have no chance nowadays.  It is most unfair.\"  \"Perhaps, after all, America never has been discovered,\" said Mr. Erskine; \"I myself would say that it had merely been detected.\"  \"Oh! but I have seen specimens of the inhabitants,\" answered the duchess vaguely.  \"I must confess that most of them are extremely pretty.  And they dress well, too.  They get all their dresses in Paris.  I wish I could afford to do the same.\"  \"They say that when good Americans die they go to Paris,\" chuckled Sir Thomas, who had a large wardrobe of Humour's cast-off clothes.  \"Really!  And where do bad Americans go to when they die?\" inquired the duchess.  \"They go to America,\" murmured Lord Henry.  Sir Thomas frowned.  \"I am afraid that your nephew is prejudiced against that great country,\" he said to Lady Agatha.  \"I have travelled all over it in cars provided by the directors, who, in such matters, are extremely civil.  I assure you that it is an education to visit it.\"  \"But must we really see Chicago in order to be educated?\" asked Mr. Erskine plaintively.  \"I don't feel up to the journey.\"  Sir Thomas waved his hand.  \"Mr. Erskine of Treadley has the world on his shelves. We practical men like to see things, not to read about them. The Americans are an extremely interesting people. They are absolutely reasonable. I think that is their distinguishing characteristic. Yes, Mr. Erskine, an absolutely reasonable people. I assure you there is no nonsense about the Americans.\"  \"How dreadful!\" cried Lord Henry.  \"I can stand brute force, but brute reason is quite unbearable.  There is something unfair about its use. It is hitting below the intellect.\"  \"I do not understand you,\" said Sir Thomas, growing rather red.  \"I do, Lord Henry,\" murmured Mr. Erskine, with a smile.  \"Paradoxes are all very well in their way....\" rejoined the baronet.  \"Was that a paradox?\" asked Mr. Erskine.  \"I did not think so.  Perhaps it was.  Well, the way of paradoxes is the way of truth.  To test reality we must see it on the tight rope.  When the verities become acrobats, we can judge them.\"  \"Dear me!\" said Lady Agatha, \"how you men argue!  I am sure I never can make out what you are talking about.  Oh!  Harry, I am quite vexed with you.  Why do you try to persuade our nice Mr. Dorian Gray to give up the East End?  I assure you he would be quite invaluable.  They would love his playing.\"  \"I want him to play to me,\" cried Lord Henry, smiling, and he looked down the table and caught a bright answering glance.  \"But they are so unhappy in Whitechapel,\" continued Lady Agatha.  \"I can sympathize with everything except suffering,\" said Lord Henry, shrugging his shoulders.  \"I cannot sympathize with that.  It is too ugly, too horrible, too distressing.  There is something terribly morbid in the modern sympathy with pain.  One should sympathize with the colour, the beauty, the joy of life.  The less said about life's sores, the better.\"  \"Still, the East End is a very important problem,\" remarked Sir Thomas with a grave shake of the head.  \"Quite so,\" answered the young lord.  \"It is the problem of slavery, and we try to solve it by amusing the slaves.\"  The politician looked at him keenly.  \"What change do you propose, then?\" he asked.  Lord Henry laughed.  \"I don't desire to change anything in England except the weather,\" he answered.  \"I am quite content with philosophic contemplation.  But, as the nineteenth century has gone bankrupt through an over-expenditure of sympathy, I would suggest that we should appeal to science to put us straight.  The advantage of the emotions is that they lead us astray, and the advantage of science is that it is not emotional.\"  \"But we have such grave responsibilities,\" ventured Mrs. Vandeleur timidly.  \"Terribly grave,\" echoed Lady Agatha.  Lord Henry looked over at Mr. Erskine.  \"Humanity takes itself too seriously.  It is the world's original sin.  If the caveman had known how to laugh, history would have been different.\"  \"You are really very comforting,\" warbled the duchess.  \"I have always felt rather guilty when I came to see your dear aunt, for I take no interest at all in the East End.  For the future I shall be able to look her in the face without a blush.\"  \"A blush is very becoming, Duchess,\" remarked Lord Henry.  \"Only when one is young,\" she answered.  \"When an old woman like myself blushes, it is a very bad sign.  Ah!  Lord Henry, I wish you would tell me how to become young again.\"  He thought for a moment.  \"Can you remember any great error that you committed in your early days, Duchess?\" he asked, looking at her across the table.  \"A great many, I fear,\" she cried.  \"Then commit them over again,\" he said gravely.  \"To get back one's youth, one has merely to repeat one's follies.\"  \"A delightful theory!\" she exclaimed.  \"I must put it into practice.\"  \"A dangerous theory!\" came from Sir Thomas's tight lips.  Lady Agatha shook her head, but could not help being amused.  Mr. Erskine listened.  \"Yes,\" he continued, \"that is one of the great secrets of life. Nowadays most people die of a sort of creeping common sense, and discover when it is too late that the only things one never regrets are one's mistakes.\"  A laugh ran round the table.  He played with the idea and grew wilful; tossed it into the air and transformed it; let it escape and recaptured it; made it iridescent with fancy and winged it with paradox.  The praise of folly, as he went on, soared into a philosophy, and philosophy herself became young, and catching the mad music of pleasure, wearing, one might fancy, her wine-stained robe and wreath of ivy, danced like a Bacchante over the hills of life, and mocked the slow Silenus for being sober.  Facts fled before her like frightened forest things.  Her white feet trod the huge press at which wise Omar sits, till the seething grape-juice rose round her bare limbs in waves of purple bubbles, or crawled in red foam over the vat's black, dripping, sloping sides.  It was an extraordinary improvisation.  He felt that the eyes of Dorian Gray were fixed on him, and the consciousness that amongst his audience there was one whose temperament he wished to fascinate seemed to give his wit keenness and to lend colour to his imagination.  He was brilliant, fantastic, irresponsible.  He charmed his listeners out of themselves, and they followed his pipe, laughing.  Dorian Gray never took his gaze off him, but sat like one under a spell, smiles chasing each other over his lips and wonder growing grave in his darkening eyes.  At last, liveried in the costume of the age, reality entered the room in the shape of a servant to tell the duchess that her carriage was waiting.  She wrung her hands in mock despair.  \"How annoying!\" she cried.  \"I must go.  I have to call for my husband at the club, to take him to some absurd meeting at Willis's Rooms, where he is going to be in the chair.  If I am late he is sure to be furious, and I couldn't have a scene in this bonnet.  It is far too fragile.  A harsh word would ruin it.  No, I must go, dear Agatha.  Good-bye, Lord Henry, you are quite delightful and dreadfully demoralizing.  I am sure I don't know what to say about your views.  You must come and dine with us some night.  Tuesday?  Are you disengaged Tuesday?\"  \"For you I would throw over anybody, Duchess,\" said Lord Henry with a bow.  \"Ah! that is very nice, and very wrong of you,\" she cried; \"so mind you come\"; and she swept out of the room, followed by Lady Agatha and the other ladies.  When Lord Henry had sat down again, Mr. Erskine moved round, and taking a chair close to him, placed his hand upon his arm.  \"You talk books away,\" he said; \"why don't you write one?\"  \"I am too fond of reading books to care to write them, Mr. Erskine.  I should like to write a novel certainly, a novel that would be as lovely as a Persian carpet and as unreal.  But there is no literary public in England for anything except newspapers, primers, and encyclopaedias. Of all people in the world the English have the least sense of the beauty of literature.\"  \"I fear you are right,\" answered Mr. Erskine.  \"I myself used to have literary ambitions, but I gave them up long ago.  And now, my dear young friend, if you will allow me to call you so, may I ask if you really meant all that you said to us at lunch?\"  \"I quite forget what I said,\" smiled Lord Henry.  \"Was it all very bad?\"  \"Very bad indeed.  In fact I consider you extremely dangerous, and if anything happens to our good duchess, we shall all look on you as being primarily responsible.  But I should like to talk to you about life. The generation into which I was born was tedious.  Some day, when you are tired of London, come down to Treadley and expound to me your philosophy of pleasure over some admirable Burgundy I am fortunate enough to possess.\"  \"I shall be charmed.  A visit to Treadley would be a great privilege. It has a perfect host, and a perfect library.\"  \"You will complete it,\" answered the old gentleman with a courteous bow.  \"And now I must bid good-bye to your excellent aunt.  I am due at the Athenaeum.  It is the hour when we sleep there.\"  \"All of you, Mr. Erskine?\"  \"Forty of us, in forty arm-chairs. We are practising for an English Academy of Letters.\"  Lord Henry laughed and rose.  \"I am going to the park,\" he cried.  As he was passing out of the door, Dorian Gray touched him on the arm. \"Let me come with you,\" he murmured.  \"But I thought you had promised Basil Hallward to go and see him,\" answered Lord Henry.  \"I would sooner come with you; yes, I feel I must come with you.  Do let me.  And you will promise to talk to me all the time?  No one talks so wonderfully as you do.\"  \"Ah!  I have talked quite enough for to-day,\" said Lord Henry, smiling. \"All I want now is to look at life.  You may come and look at it with me, if you care to.\"\n",

      "As he was sitting at breakfast next morning, Basil Hallward was shown into the room.  \"I am so glad I have found you, Dorian,\" he said gravely.  \"I called last night, and they told me you were at the opera.  Of course, I knew that was impossible.  But I wish you had left word where you had really gone to.  I passed a dreadful evening, half afraid that one tragedy might be followed by another.  I think you might have telegraphed for me when you heard of it first.  I read of it quite by chance in a late edition of _The Globe_ that I picked up at the club.  I came here at once and was miserable at not finding you.  I can't tell you how heart-broken I am about the whole thing.  I know what you must suffer. But where were you?  Did you go down and see the girl's mother?  For a moment I thought of following you there.  They gave the address in the paper.  Somewhere in the Euston Road, isn't it?  But I was afraid of intruding upon a sorrow that I could not lighten.  Poor woman!  What a state she must be in!  And her only child, too!  What did she say about it all?\"  \"My dear Basil, how do I know?\" murmured Dorian Gray, sipping some pale-yellow wine from a delicate, gold-beaded bubble of Venetian glass and looking dreadfully bored.  \"I was at the opera.  You should have come on there.  I met Lady Gwendolen, Harry's sister, for the first time.  We were in her box.  She is perfectly charming; and Patti sang divinely.  Don't talk about horrid subjects.  If one doesn't talk about a thing, it has never happened.  It is simply expression, as Harry says, that gives reality to things.  I may mention that she was not the woman's only child.  There is a son, a charming fellow, I believe.  But he is not on the stage.  He is a sailor, or something.  And now, tell me about yourself and what you are painting.\"  \"You went to the opera?\" said Hallward, speaking very slowly and with a strained touch of pain in his voice.  \"You went to the opera while Sibyl Vane was lying dead in some sordid lodging?  You can talk to me of other women being charming, and of Patti singing divinely, before the girl you loved has even the quiet of a grave to sleep in?  Why, man, there are horrors in store for that little white body of hers!\"  \"Stop, Basil!  I won't hear it!\" cried Dorian, leaping to his feet. \"You must not tell me about things.  What is done is done.  What is past is past.\"  \"You call yesterday the past?\"  \"What has the actual lapse of time got to do with it?  It is only shallow people who require years to get rid of an emotion.  A man who is master of himself can end a sorrow as easily as he can invent a pleasure.  I don't want to be at the mercy of my emotions.  I want to use them, to enjoy them, and to dominate them.\"  \"Dorian, this is horrible!  Something has changed you completely.  You look exactly the same wonderful boy who, day after day, used to come down to my studio to sit for his picture.  But you were simple, natural, and affectionate then.  You were the most unspoiled creature in the whole world.  Now, I don't know what has come over you.  You talk as if you had no heart, no pity in you.  It is all Harry's influence.  I see that.\"  The lad flushed up and, going to the window, looked out for a few moments on the green, flickering, sun-lashed garden.  \"I owe a great deal to Harry, Basil,\" he said at last, \"more than I owe to you.  You only taught me to be vain.\"  \"Well, I am punished for that, Dorian--or shall be some day.\"  \"I don't know what you mean, Basil,\" he exclaimed, turning round.  \"I don't know what you want.  What do you want?\"  \"I want the Dorian Gray I used to paint,\" said the artist sadly.  \"Basil,\" said the lad, going over to him and putting his hand on his shoulder, \"you have come too late.  Yesterday, when I heard that Sibyl Vane had killed herself--\"  \"Killed herself!  Good heavens! is there no doubt about that?\" cried Hallward, looking up at him with an expression of horror.  \"My dear Basil!  Surely you don't think it was a vulgar accident?  Of course she killed herself.\"  The elder man buried his face in his hands.  \"How fearful,\" he muttered, and a shudder ran through him.  \"No,\" said Dorian Gray, \"there is nothing fearful about it.  It is one of the great romantic tragedies of the age.  As a rule, people who act lead the most commonplace lives.  They are good husbands, or faithful wives, or something tedious.  You know what I mean--middle-class virtue and all that kind of thing.  How different Sibyl was!  She lived her finest tragedy.  She was always a heroine.  The last night she played--the night you saw her--she acted badly because she had known the reality of love.  When she knew its unreality, she died, as Juliet might have died.  She passed again into the sphere of art.  There is something of the martyr about her.  Her death has all the pathetic uselessness of martyrdom, all its wasted beauty.  But, as I was saying, you must not think I have not suffered.  If you had come in yesterday at a particular moment--about half-past five, perhaps, or a quarter to six--you would have found me in tears.  Even Harry, who was here, who brought me the news, in fact, had no idea what I was going through.  I suffered immensely.  Then it passed away.  I cannot repeat an emotion. No one can, except sentimentalists.  And you are awfully unjust, Basil. You come down here to console me.  That is charming of you.  You find me consoled, and you are furious.  How like a sympathetic person!  You remind me of a story Harry told me about a certain philanthropist who spent twenty years of his life in trying to get some grievance redressed, or some unjust law altered--I forget exactly what it was. Finally he succeeded, and nothing could exceed his disappointment.  He had absolutely nothing to do, almost died of _ennui_, and became a confirmed misanthrope.  And besides, my dear old Basil, if you really want to console me, teach me rather to forget what has happened, or to see it from a proper artistic point of view.  Was it not Gautier who used to write about _la consolation des arts_?  I remember picking up a little vellum-covered book in your studio one day and chancing on that delightful phrase.  Well, I am not like that young man you told me of when we were down at Marlow together, the young man who used to say that yellow satin could console one for all the miseries of life.  I love beautiful things that one can touch and handle.  Old brocades, green bronzes, lacquer-work, carved ivories, exquisite surroundings, luxury, pomp--there is much to be got from all these.  But the artistic temperament that they create, or at any rate reveal, is still more to me.  To become the spectator of one's own life, as Harry says, is to escape the suffering of life.  I know you are surprised at my talking to you like this.  You have not realized how I have developed.  I was a schoolboy when you knew me.  I am a man now.  I have new passions, new thoughts, new ideas.  I am different, but you must not like me less.  I am changed, but you must always be my friend.  Of course, I am very fond of Harry.  But I know that you are better than he is.  You are not stronger--you are too much afraid of life--but you are better.  And how happy we used to be together!  Don't leave me, Basil, and don't quarrel with me.  I am what I am.  There is nothing more to be said.\"  The painter felt strangely moved.  The lad was infinitely dear to him, and his personality had been the great turning point in his art.  He could not bear the idea of reproaching him any more.  After all, his indifference was probably merely a mood that would pass away.  There was so much in him that was good, so much in him that was noble.  \"Well, Dorian,\" he said at length, with a sad smile, \"I won't speak to you again about this horrible thing, after to-day.  I only trust your name won't be mentioned in connection with it.  The inquest is to take place this afternoon.  Have they summoned you?\"  Dorian shook his head, and a look of annoyance passed over his face at the mention of the word \"inquest.\"  There was something so crude and vulgar about everything of the kind.  \"They don't know my name,\" he answered.  \"But surely she did?\"  \"Only my Christian name, and that I am quite sure she never mentioned to any one.  She told me once that they were all rather curious to learn who I was, and that she invariably told them my name was Prince Charming.  It was pretty of her.  You must do me a drawing of Sibyl, Basil.  I should like to have something more of her than the memory of a few kisses and some broken pathetic words.\"  \"I will try and do something, Dorian, if it would please you.  But you must come and sit to me yourself again.  I can't get on without you.\"  \"I can never sit to you again, Basil.  It is impossible!\" he exclaimed, starting back.  The painter stared at him.  \"My dear boy, what nonsense!\" he cried. \"Do you mean to say you don't like what I did of you?  Where is it? Why have you pulled the screen in front of it?  Let me look at it.  It is the best thing I have ever done.  Do take the screen away, Dorian. It is simply disgraceful of your servant hiding my work like that.  I felt the room looked different as I came in.\"  \"My servant has nothing to do with it, Basil.  You don't imagine I let him arrange my room for me?  He settles my flowers for me sometimes--that is all.  No; I did it myself.  The light was too strong on the portrait.\"  \"Too strong!  Surely not, my dear fellow?  It is an admirable place for it.  Let me see it.\"  And Hallward walked towards the corner of the room.  A cry of terror broke from Dorian Gray's lips, and he rushed between the painter and the screen.  \"Basil,\" he said, looking very pale, \"you must not look at it.  I don't wish you to.\"  \"Not look at my own work!  You are not serious.  Why shouldn't I look at it?\" exclaimed Hallward, laughing.  \"If you try to look at it, Basil, on my word of honour I will never speak to you again as long as I live.  I am quite serious.  I don't offer any explanation, and you are not to ask for any.  But, remember, if you touch this screen, everything is over between us.\"  Hallward was thunderstruck.  He looked at Dorian Gray in absolute amazement.  He had never seen him like this before.  The lad was actually pallid with rage.  His hands were clenched, and the pupils of his eyes were like disks of blue fire.  He was trembling all over.  \"Dorian!\"  \"Don't speak!\"  \"But what is the matter?  Of course I won't look at it if you don't want me to,\" he said, rather coldly, turning on his heel and going over towards the window.  \"But, really, it seems rather absurd that I shouldn't see my own work, especially as I am going to exhibit it in Paris in the autumn.  I shall probably have to give it another coat of varnish before that, so I must see it some day, and why not to-day?\"  \"To exhibit it!  You want to exhibit it?\" exclaimed Dorian Gray, a strange sense of terror creeping over him.  Was the world going to be shown his secret?  Were people to gape at the mystery of his life? That was impossible.  Something--he did not know what--had to be done at once.  \"Yes; I don't suppose you will object to that.  Georges Petit is going to collect all my best pictures for a special exhibition in the Rue de Seze, which will open the first week in October.  The portrait will only be away a month.  I should think you could easily spare it for that time.  In fact, you are sure to be out of town.  And if you keep it always behind a screen, you can't care much about it.\"  Dorian Gray passed his hand over his forehead.  There were beads of perspiration there.  He felt that he was on the brink of a horrible danger.  \"You told me a month ago that you would never exhibit it,\" he cried.  \"Why have you changed your mind?  You people who go in for being consistent have just as many moods as others have.  The only difference is that your moods are rather meaningless.  You can't have forgotten that you assured me most solemnly that nothing in the world would induce you to send it to any exhibition.  You told Harry exactly the same thing.\" He stopped suddenly, and a gleam of light came into his eyes.  He remembered that Lord Henry had said to him once, half seriously and half in jest, \"If you want to have a strange quarter of an hour, get Basil to tell you why he won't exhibit your picture.  He told me why he wouldn't, and it was a revelation to me.\"  Yes, perhaps Basil, too, had his secret.  He would ask him and try.  \"Basil,\" he said, coming over quite close and looking him straight in the face, \"we have each of us a secret.  Let me know yours, and I shall tell you mine.  What was your reason for refusing to exhibit my picture?\"  The painter shuddered in spite of himself.  \"Dorian, if I told you, you might like me less than you do, and you would certainly laugh at me.  I could not bear your doing either of those two things.  If you wish me never to look at your picture again, I am content.  I have always you to look at.  If you wish the best work I have ever done to be hidden from the world, I am satisfied.  Your friendship is dearer to me than any fame or reputation.\"  \"No, Basil, you must tell me,\" insisted Dorian Gray.  \"I think I have a right to know.\"  His feeling of terror had passed away, and curiosity had taken its place.  He was determined to find out Basil Hallward's mystery.  \"Let us sit down, Dorian,\" said the painter, looking troubled.  \"Let us sit down.  And just answer me one question.  Have you noticed in the picture something curious?--something that probably at first did not strike you, but that revealed itself to you suddenly?\"  \"Basil!\" cried the lad, clutching the arms of his chair with trembling hands and gazing at him with wild startled eyes.  \"I see you did.  Don't speak.  Wait till you hear what I have to say. Dorian, from the moment I met you, your personality had the most extraordinary influence over me.  I was dominated, soul, brain, and power, by you.  You became to me the visible incarnation of that unseen ideal whose memory haunts us artists like an exquisite dream.  I worshipped you.  I grew jealous of every one to whom you spoke.  I wanted to have you all to myself.  I was only happy when I was with you.  When you were away from me, you were still present in my art.... Of course, I never let you know anything about this.  It would have been impossible.  You would not have understood it.  I hardly understood it myself.  I only knew that I had seen perfection face to face, and that the world had become wonderful to my eyes--too wonderful, perhaps, for in such mad worships there is peril, the peril of losing them, no less than the peril of keeping them....  Weeks and weeks went on, and I grew more and more absorbed in you.  Then came a new development.  I had drawn you as Paris in dainty armour, and as Adonis with huntsman's cloak and polished boar-spear. Crowned with heavy lotus-blossoms you had sat on the prow of Adrian's barge, gazing across the green turbid Nile.  You had leaned over the still pool of some Greek woodland and seen in the water's silent silver the marvel of your own face.  And it had all been what art should be--unconscious, ideal, and remote.  One day, a fatal day I sometimes think, I determined to paint a wonderful portrait of you as you actually are, not in the costume of dead ages, but in your own dress and in your own time.  Whether it was the realism of the method, or the mere wonder of your own personality, thus directly presented to me without mist or veil, I cannot tell.  But I know that as I worked at it, every flake and film of colour seemed to me to reveal my secret.  I grew afraid that others would know of my idolatry.  I felt, Dorian, that I had told too much, that I had put too much of myself into it.  Then it was that I resolved never to allow the picture to be exhibited.  You were a little annoyed; but then you did not realize all that it meant to me. Harry, to whom I talked about it, laughed at me.  But I did not mind that.  When the picture was finished, and I sat alone with it, I felt that I was right.... Well, after a few days the thing left my studio, and as soon as I had got rid of the intolerable fascination of its presence, it seemed to me that I had been foolish in imagining that I had seen anything in it, more than that you were extremely good-looking and that I could paint.  Even now I cannot help feeling that it is a mistake to think that the passion one feels in creation is ever really shown in the work one creates.  Art is always more abstract than we fancy.  Form and colour tell us of form and colour--that is all.  It often seems to me that art conceals the artist far more completely than it ever reveals him.  And so when I got this offer from Paris, I determined to make your portrait the principal thing in my exhibition. It never occurred to me that you would refuse.  I see now that you were right.  The picture cannot be shown.  You must not be angry with me, Dorian, for what I have told you.  As I said to Harry, once, you are made to be worshipped.\"  Dorian Gray drew a long breath.  The colour came back to his cheeks, and a smile played about his lips.  The peril was over.  He was safe for the time.  Yet he could not help feeling infinite pity for the painter who had just made this strange confession to him, and wondered if he himself would ever be so dominated by the personality of a friend.  Lord Henry had the charm of being very dangerous.  But that was all.  He was too clever and too cynical to be really fond of. Would there ever be some one who would fill him with a strange idolatry?  Was that one of the things that life had in store?  \"It is extraordinary to me, Dorian,\" said Hallward, \"that you should have seen this in the portrait.  Did you really see it?\"  \"I saw something in it,\" he answered, \"something that seemed to me very curious.\"  \"Well, you don't mind my looking at the thing now?\"  Dorian shook his head.  \"You must not ask me that, Basil.  I could not possibly let you stand in front of that picture.\"  \"You will some day, surely?\"  \"Never.\"  \"Well, perhaps you are right.  And now good-bye, Dorian.  You have been the one person in my life who has really influenced my art.  Whatever I have done that is good, I owe to you.  Ah! you don't know what it cost me to tell you all that I have told you.\"  \"My dear Basil,\" said Dorian, \"what have you told me?  Simply that you felt that you admired me too much.  That is not even a compliment.\"  \"It was not intended as a compliment.  It was a confession.  Now that I have made it, something seems to have gone out of me.  Perhaps one should never put one's worship into words.\"  \"It was a very disappointing confession.\"  \"Why, what did you expect, Dorian?  You didn't see anything else in the picture, did you?  There was nothing else to see?\"  \"No; there was nothing else to see.  Why do you ask?  But you mustn't talk about worship.  It is foolish.  You and I are friends, Basil, and we must always remain so.\"  \"You have got Harry,\" said the painter sadly.  \"Oh, Harry!\" cried the lad, with a ripple of laughter.  \"Harry spends his days in saying what is incredible and his evenings in doing what is improbable.  Just the sort of life I would like to lead.  But still I don't think I would go to Harry if I were in trouble.  I would sooner go to you, Basil.\"  \"You will sit to me again?\"  \"Impossible!\"  \"You spoil my life as an artist by refusing, Dorian.  No man comes across two ideal things.  Few come across one.\"  \"I can't explain it to you, Basil, but I must never sit to you again. There is something fatal about a portrait.  It has a life of its own. I will come and have tea with you.  That will be just as pleasant.\"  \"Pleasanter for you, I am afraid,\" murmured Hallward regretfully.  \"And now good-bye. I am sorry you won't let me look at the picture once again.  But that can't be helped.  I quite understand what you feel about it.\"  As he left the room, Dorian Gray smiled to himself.  Poor Basil!  How little he knew of the true reason!  And how strange it was that, instead of having been forced to reveal his own secret, he had succeeded, almost by chance, in wresting a secret from his friend!  How much that strange confession explained to him!  The painter's absurd fits of jealousy, his wild devotion, his extravagant panegyrics, his curious reticences--he understood them all now, and he felt sorry. There seemed to him to be something tragic in a friendship so coloured by romance.  He sighed and touched the bell.  The portrait must be hidden away at all costs.  He could not run such a risk of discovery again.  It had been mad of him to have allowed the thing to remain, even for an hour, in a room to which any of his friends had access.\n",

      "For years, Dorian Gray could not free himself from the influence of this book.  Or perhaps it would be more accurate to say that he never sought to free himself from it.  He procured from Paris no less than nine large-paper copies of the first edition, and had them bound in different colours, so that they might suit his various moods and the changing fancies of a nature over which he seemed, at times, to have almost entirely lost control.  The hero, the wonderful young Parisian in whom the romantic and the scientific temperaments were so strangely blended, became to him a kind of prefiguring type of himself.  And, indeed, the whole book seemed to him to contain the story of his own life, written before he had lived it.  In one point he was more fortunate than the novel's fantastic hero.  He never knew--never, indeed, had any cause to know--that somewhat grotesque dread of mirrors, and polished metal surfaces, and still water which came upon the young Parisian so early in his life, and was occasioned by the sudden decay of a beau that had once, apparently, been so remarkable.  It was with an almost cruel joy--and perhaps in nearly every joy, as certainly in every pleasure, cruelty has its place--that he used to read the latter part of the book, with its really tragic, if somewhat overemphasized, account of the sorrow and despair of one who had himself lost what in others, and the world, he had most dearly valued.  For the wonderful beauty that had so fascinated Basil Hallward, and many others besides him, seemed never to leave him.  Even those who had heard the most evil things against him--and from time to time strange rumours about his mode of life crept through London and became the chatter of the clubs--could not believe anything to his dishonour when they saw him.  He had always the look of one who had kept himself unspotted from the world.  Men who talked grossly became silent when Dorian Gray entered the room.  There was something in the purity of his face that rebuked them.  His mere presence seemed to recall to them the memory of the innocence that they had tarnished.  They wondered how one so charming and graceful as he was could have escaped the stain of an age that was at once sordid and sensual.  Often, on returning home from one of those mysterious and prolonged absences that gave rise to such strange conjecture among those who were his friends, or thought that they were so, he himself would creep upstairs to the locked room, open the door with the key that never left him now, and stand, with a mirror, in front of the portrait that Basil Hallward had painted of him, looking now at the evil and aging face on the canvas, and now at the fair young face that laughed back at him from the polished glass.  The very sharpness of the contrast used to quicken his sense of pleasure.  He grew more and more enamoured of his own beauty, more and more interested in the corruption of his own soul. He would examine with minute care, and sometimes with a monstrous and terrible delight, the hideous lines that seared the wrinkling forehead or crawled around the heavy sensual mouth, wondering sometimes which were the more horrible, the signs of sin or the signs of age.  He would place his white hands beside the coarse bloated hands of the picture, and smile.  He mocked the misshapen body and the failing limbs.  There were moments, indeed, at night, when, lying sleepless in his own delicately scented chamber, or in the sordid room of the little ill-famed tavern near the docks which, under an assumed name and in disguise, it was his habit to frequent, he would think of the ruin he had brought upon his soul with a pity that was all the more poignant because it was purely selfish.  But moments such as these were rare. That curiosity about life which Lord Henry had first stirred in him, as they sat together in the garden of their friend, seemed to increase with gratification.  The more he knew, the more he desired to know.  He had mad hungers that grew more ravenous as he fed them.  Yet he was not really reckless, at any rate in his relations to society.  Once or twice every month during the winter, and on each Wednesday evening while the season lasted, he would throw open to the world his beautiful house and have the most celebrated musicians of the day to charm his guests with the wonders of their art.  His little dinners, in the settling of which Lord Henry always assisted him, were noted as much for the careful selection and placing of those invited, as for the exquisite taste shown in the decoration of the table, with its subtle symphonic arrangements of exotic flowers, and embroidered cloths, and antique plate of gold and silver.  Indeed, there were many, especially among the very young men, who saw, or fancied that they saw, in Dorian Gray the true realization of a type of which they had often dreamed in Eton or Oxford days, a type that was to combine something of the real culture of the scholar with all the grace and distinction and perfect manner of a citizen of the world.  To them he seemed to be of the company of those whom Dante describes as having sought to \"make themselves perfect by the worship of beauty.\"  Like Gautier, he was one for whom \"the visible world existed.\"  And, certainly, to him life itself was the first, the greatest, of the arts, and for it all the other arts seemed to be but a preparation. Fashion, by which what is really fantastic becomes for a moment universal, and dandyism, which, in its own way, is an attempt to assert the absolute modernity of beauty, had, of course, their fascination for him.  His mode of dressing, and the particular styles that from time to time he affected, had their marked influence on the young exquisites of the Mayfair balls and Pall Mall club windows, who copied him in everything that he did, and tried to reproduce the accidental charm of his graceful, though to him only half-serious, fopperies.  For, while he was but too ready to accept the position that was almost immediately offered to him on his coming of age, and found, indeed, a subtle pleasure in the thought that he might really become to the London of his own day what to imperial Neronian Rome the author of the Satyricon once had been, yet in his inmost heart he desired to be something more than a mere _arbiter elegantiarum_, to be consulted on the wearing of a jewel, or the knotting of a necktie, or the conduct of a cane.  He sought to elaborate some new scheme of life that would have its reasoned philosophy and its ordered principles, and find in the spiritualizing of the senses its highest realization.  The worship of the senses has often, and with much justice, been decried, men feeling a natural instinct of terror about passions and sensations that seem stronger than themselves, and that they are conscious of sharing with the less highly organized forms of existence. But it appeared to Dorian Gray that the true nature of the senses had never been understood, and that they had remained savage and animal merely because the world had sought to starve them into submission or to kill them by pain, instead of aiming at making them elements of a new spirituality, of which a fine instinct for beauty was to be the dominant characteristic.  As he looked back upon man moving through history, he was haunted by a feeling of loss.  So much had been surrendered! and to such little purpose!  There had been mad wilful rejections, monstrous forms of self-torture and self-denial, whose origin was fear and whose result was a degradation infinitely more terrible than that fancied degradation from which, in their ignorance, they had sought to escape; Nature, in her wonderful irony, driving out the anchorite to feed with the wild animals of the desert and giving to the hermit the beasts of the field as his companions.  Yes:  there was to be, as Lord Henry had prophesied, a new Hedonism that was to recreate life and to save it from that harsh uncomely puritanism that is having, in our own day, its curious revival.  It was to have its service of the intellect, certainly, yet it was never to accept any theory or system that would involve the sacrifice of any mode of passionate experience.  Its aim, indeed, was to be experience itself, and not the fruits of experience, sweet or bitter as they might be.  Of the asceticism that deadens the senses, as of the vulgar profligacy that dulls them, it was to know nothing.  But it was to teach man to concentrate himself upon the moments of a life that is itself but a moment.  There are few of us who have not sometimes wakened before dawn, either after one of those dreamless nights that make us almost enamoured of death, or one of those nights of horror and misshapen joy, when through the chambers of the brain sweep phantoms more terrible than reality itself, and instinct with that vivid life that lurks in all grotesques, and that lends to Gothic art its enduring vitality, this art being, one might fancy, especially the art of those whose minds have been troubled with the malady of reverie.  Gradually white fingers creep through the curtains, and they appear to tremble.  In black fantastic shapes, dumb shadows crawl into the corners of the room and crouch there.  Outside, there is the stirring of birds among the leaves, or the sound of men going forth to their work, or the sigh and sob of the wind coming down from the hills and wandering round the silent house, as though it feared to wake the sleepers and yet must needs call forth sleep from her purple cave.  Veil after veil of thin dusky gauze is lifted, and by degrees the forms and colours of things are restored to them, and we watch the dawn remaking the world in its antique pattern.  The wan mirrors get back their mimic life.  The flameless tapers stand where we had left them, and beside them lies the half-cut book that we had been studying, or the wired flower that we had worn at the ball, or the letter that we had been afraid to read, or that we had read too often. Nothing seems to us changed.  Out of the unreal shadows of the night comes back the real life that we had known.  We have to resume it where we had left off, and there steals over us a terrible sense of the necessity for the continuance of energy in the same wearisome round of stereotyped habits, or a wild longing, it may be, that our eyelids might open some morning upon a world that had been refashioned anew in the darkness for our pleasure, a world in which things would have fresh shapes and colours, and be changed, or have other secrets, a world in which the past would have little or no place, or survive, at any rate, in no conscious form of obligation or regret, the remembrance even of joy having its bitterness and the memories of pleasure their pain.  It was the creation of such worlds as these that seemed to Dorian Gray to be the true object, or amongst the true objects, of life; and in his search for sensations that would be at once new and delightful, and possess that element of strangeness that is so essential to romance, he would often adopt certain modes of thought that he knew to be really alien to his nature, abandon himself to their subtle influences, and then, having, as it were, caught their colour and satisfied his intellectual curiosity, leave them with that curious indifference that is not incompatible with a real ardour of temperament, and that, indeed, according to certain modern psychologists, is often a condition of it.  It was rumoured of him once that he was about to join the Roman Catholic communion, and certainly the Roman ritual had always a great attraction for him.  The daily sacrifice, more awful really than all the sacrifices of the antique world, stirred him as much by its superb rejection of the evidence of the senses as by the primitive simplicity of its elements and the eternal pathos of the human tragedy that it sought to symbolize.  He loved to kneel down on the cold marble pavement and watch the priest, in his stiff flowered dalmatic, slowly and with white hands moving aside the veil of the tabernacle, or raising aloft the jewelled, lantern-shaped monstrance with that pallid wafer that at times, one would fain think, is indeed the \"_panis caelestis_,\" the bread of angels, or, robed in the garments of the Passion of Christ, breaking the Host into the chalice and smiting his breast for his sins.  The fuming censers that the grave boys, in their lace and scarlet, tossed into the air like great gilt flowers had their subtle fascination for him.  As he passed out, he used to look with wonder at the black confessionals and long to sit in the dim shadow of one of them and listen to men and women whispering through the worn grating the true story of their lives.  But he never fell into the error of arresting his intellectual development by any formal acceptance of creed or system, or of mistaking, for a house in which to live, an inn that is but suitable for the sojourn of a night, or for a few hours of a night in which there are no stars and the moon is in travail.  Mysticism, with its marvellous power of making common things strange to us, and the subtle antinomianism that always seems to accompany it, moved him for a season; and for a season he inclined to the materialistic doctrines of the _Darwinismus_ movement in Germany, and found a curious pleasure in tracing the thoughts and passions of men to some pearly cell in the brain, or some white nerve in the body, delighting in the conception of the absolute dependence of the spirit on certain physical conditions, morbid or healthy, normal or diseased.  Yet, as has been said of him before, no theory of life seemed to him to be of any importance compared with life itself.  He felt keenly conscious of how barren all intellectual speculation is when separated from action and experiment. He knew that the senses, no less than the soul, have their spiritual mysteries to reveal.  And so he would now study perfumes and the secrets of their manufacture, distilling heavily scented oils and burning odorous gums from the East.  He saw that there was no mood of the mind that had not its counterpart in the sensuous life, and set himself to discover their true relations, wondering what there was in frankincense that made one mystical, and in ambergris that stirred one's passions, and in violets that woke the memory of dead romances, and in musk that troubled the brain, and in champak that stained the imagination; and seeking often to elaborate a real psychology of perfumes, and to estimate the several influences of sweet-smelling roots and scented, pollen-laden flowers; of aromatic balms and of dark and fragrant woods; of spikenard, that sickens; of hovenia, that makes men mad; and of aloes, that are said to be able to expel melancholy from the soul.  At another time he devoted himself entirely to music, and in a long latticed room, with a vermilion-and-gold ceiling and walls of olive-green lacquer, he used to give curious concerts in which mad gipsies tore wild music from little zithers, or grave, yellow-shawled Tunisians plucked at the strained strings of monstrous lutes, while grinning Negroes beat monotonously upon copper drums and, crouching upon scarlet mats, slim turbaned Indians blew through long pipes of reed or brass and charmed--or feigned to charm--great hooded snakes and horrible horned adders.  The harsh intervals and shrill discords of barbaric music stirred him at times when Schubert's grace, and Chopin's beautiful sorrows, and the mighty harmonies of Beethoven himself, fell unheeded on his ear.  He collected together from all parts of the world the strangest instruments that could be found, either in the tombs of dead nations or among the few savage tribes that have survived contact with Western civilizations, and loved to touch and try them.  He had the mysterious _juruparis_ of the Rio Negro Indians, that women are not allowed to look at and that even youths may not see till they have been subjected to fasting and scourging, and the earthen jars of the Peruvians that have the shrill cries of birds, and flutes of human bones such as Alfonso de Ovalle heard in Chile, and the sonorous green jaspers that are found near Cuzco and give forth a note of singular sweetness.  He had painted gourds filled with pebbles that rattled when they were shaken; the long _clarin_ of the Mexicans, into which the performer does not blow, but through which he inhales the air; the harsh _ture_ of the Amazon tribes, that is sounded by the sentinels who sit all day long in high trees, and can be heard, it is said, at a distance of three leagues; the _teponaztli_, that has two vibrating tongues of wood and is beaten with sticks that are smeared with an elastic gum obtained from the milky juice of plants; the _yotl_-bells of the Aztecs, that are hung in clusters like grapes; and a huge cylindrical drum, covered with the skins of great serpents, like the one that Bernal Diaz saw when he went with Cortes into the Mexican temple, and of whose doleful sound he has left us so vivid a description.  The fantastic character of these instruments fascinated him, and he felt a curious delight in the thought that art, like Nature, has her monsters, things of bestial shape and with hideous voices.  Yet, after some time, he wearied of them, and would sit in his box at the opera, either alone or with Lord Henry, listening in rapt pleasure to \"Tannhauser\" and seeing in the prelude to that great work of art a presentation of the tragedy of his own soul.  On one occasion he took up the study of jewels, and appeared at a costume ball as Anne de Joyeuse, Admiral of France, in a dress covered with five hundred and sixty pearls.  This taste enthralled him for years, and, indeed, may be said never to have left him.  He would often spend a whole day settling and resettling in their cases the various stones that he had collected, such as the olive-green chrysoberyl that turns red by lamplight, the cymophane with its wirelike line of silver, the pistachio-coloured peridot, rose-pink and wine-yellow topazes, carbuncles of fiery scarlet with tremulous, four-rayed stars, flame-red cinnamon-stones, orange and violet spinels, and amethysts with their alternate layers of ruby and sapphire.  He loved the red gold of the sunstone, and the moonstone's pearly whiteness, and the broken rainbow of the milky opal.  He procured from Amsterdam three emeralds of extraordinary size and richness of colour, and had a turquoise _de la vieille roche_ that was the envy of all the connoisseurs.  He discovered wonderful stories, also, about jewels.  In Alphonso's Clericalis Disciplina a serpent was mentioned with eyes of real jacinth, and in the romantic history of Alexander, the Conqueror of Emathia was said to have found in the vale of Jordan snakes \"with collars of real emeralds growing on their backs.\" There was a gem in the brain of the dragon, Philostratus told us, and \"by the exhibition of golden letters and a scarlet robe\" the monster could be thrown into a magical sleep and slain.  According to the great alchemist, Pierre de Boniface, the diamond rendered a man invisible, and the agate of India made him eloquent.  The cornelian appeased anger, and the hyacinth provoked sleep, and the amethyst drove away the fumes of wine.  The garnet cast out demons, and the hydropicus deprived the moon of her colour.  The selenite waxed and waned with the moon, and the meloceus, that discovers thieves, could be affected only by the blood of kids. Leonardus Camillus had seen a white stone taken from the brain of a newly killed toad, that was a certain antidote against poison.  The bezoar, that was found in the heart of the Arabian deer, was a charm that could cure the plague.  In the nests of Arabian birds was the aspilates, that, according to Democritus, kept the wearer from any danger by fire.  The King of Ceilan rode through his city with a large ruby in his hand, as the ceremony of his coronation.  The gates of the palace of John the Priest were \"made of sardius, with the horn of the horned snake inwrought, so that no man might bring poison within.\" Over the gable were \"two golden apples, in which were two carbuncles,\" so that the gold might shine by day and the carbuncles by night.  In Lodge's strange romance 'A Margarite of America', it was stated that in the chamber of the queen one could behold \"all the chaste ladies of the world, inchased out of silver, looking through fair mirrours of chrysolites, carbuncles, sapphires, and greene emeraults.\" Marco Polo had seen the inhabitants of Zipangu place rose-coloured pearls in the mouths of the dead.  A sea-monster had been enamoured of the pearl that the diver brought to King Perozes, and had slain the thief, and mourned for seven moons over its loss.  When the Huns lured the king into the great pit, he flung it away--Procopius tells the story--nor was it ever found again, though the Emperor Anastasius offered five hundred-weight of gold pieces for it.  The King of Malabar had shown to a certain Venetian a rosary of three hundred and four pearls, one for every god that he worshipped.  When the Duke de Valentinois, son of Alexander VI, visited Louis XII of France, his horse was loaded with gold leaves, according to Brantome, and his cap had double rows of rubies that threw out a great light. Charles of England had ridden in stirrups hung with four hundred and twenty-one diamonds.  Richard II had a coat, valued at thirty thousand marks, which was covered with balas rubies.  Hall described Henry VIII, on his way to the Tower previous to his coronation, as wearing \"a jacket of raised gold, the placard embroidered with diamonds and other rich stones, and a great bauderike about his neck of large balasses.\" The favourites of James I wore ear-rings of emeralds set in gold filigrane.  Edward II gave to Piers Gaveston a suit of red-gold armour studded with jacinths, a collar of gold roses set with turquoise-stones, and a skull-cap _parseme_ with pearls.  Henry II wore jewelled gloves reaching to the elbow, and had a hawk-glove sewn with twelve rubies and fifty-two great orients.  The ducal hat of Charles the Rash, the last Duke of Burgundy of his race, was hung with pear-shaped pearls and studded with sapphires.  How exquisite life had once been!  How gorgeous in its pomp and decoration!  Even to read of the luxury of the dead was wonderful.  Then he turned his attention to embroideries and to the tapestries that performed the office of frescoes in the chill rooms of the northern nations of Europe.  As he investigated the subject--and he always had an extraordinary faculty of becoming absolutely absorbed for the moment in whatever he took up--he was almost saddened by the reflection of the ruin that time brought on beautiful and wonderful things.  He, at any rate, had escaped that.  Summer followed summer, and the yellow jonquils bloomed and died many times, and nights of horror repeated the story of their shame, but he was unchanged.  No winter marred his face or stained his flowerlike bloom.  How different it was with material things!  Where had they passed to?  Where was the great crocus-coloured robe, on which the gods fought against the giants, that had been worked by brown girls for the pleasure of Athena?  Where the huge velarium that Nero had stretched across the Colosseum at Rome, that Titan sail of purple on which was represented the starry sky, and Apollo driving a chariot drawn by white, gilt-reined steeds?  He longed to see the curious table-napkins wrought for the Priest of the Sun, on which were displayed all the dainties and viands that could be wanted for a feast; the mortuary cloth of King Chilperic, with its three hundred golden bees; the fantastic robes that excited the indignation of the Bishop of Pontus and were figured with \"lions, panthers, bears, dogs, forests, rocks, hunters--all, in fact, that a painter can copy from nature\"; and the coat that Charles of Orleans once wore, on the sleeves of which were embroidered the verses of a song beginning \"_Madame, je suis tout joyeux_,\" the musical accompaniment of the words being wrought in gold thread, and each note, of square shape in those days, formed with four pearls.  He read of the room that was prepared at the palace at Rheims for the use of Queen Joan of Burgundy and was decorated with \"thirteen hundred and twenty-one parrots, made in broidery, and blazoned with the king's arms, and five hundred and sixty-one butterflies, whose wings were similarly ornamented with the arms of the queen, the whole worked in gold.\"  Catherine de Medicis had a mourning-bed made for her of black velvet powdered with crescents and suns.  Its curtains were of damask, with leafy wreaths and garlands, figured upon a gold and silver ground, and fringed along the edges with broideries of pearls, and it stood in a room hung with rows of the queen's devices in cut black velvet upon cloth of silver.  Louis XIV had gold embroidered caryatides fifteen feet high in his apartment.  The state bed of Sobieski, King of Poland, was made of Smyrna gold brocade embroidered in turquoises with verses from the Koran.  Its supports were of silver gilt, beautifully chased, and profusely set with enamelled and jewelled medallions.  It had been taken from the Turkish camp before Vienna, and the standard of Mohammed had stood beneath the tremulous gilt of its canopy.  And so, for a whole year, he sought to accumulate the most exquisite specimens that he could find of textile and embroidered work, getting the dainty Delhi muslins, finely wrought with gold-thread palmates and stitched over with iridescent beetles' wings; the Dacca gauzes, that from their transparency are known in the East as \"woven air,\" and \"running water,\" and \"evening dew\"; strange figured cloths from Java; elaborate yellow Chinese hangings; books bound in tawny satins or fair blue silks and wrought with _fleurs-de-lis_, birds and images; veils of _lacis_ worked in Hungary point; Sicilian brocades and stiff Spanish velvets; Georgian work, with its gilt coins, and Japanese _Foukousas_, with their green-toned golds and their marvellously plumaged birds.  He had a special passion, also, for ecclesiastical vestments, as indeed he had for everything connected with the service of the Church.  In the long cedar chests that lined the west gallery of his house, he had stored away many rare and beautiful specimens of what is really the raiment of the Bride of Christ, who must wear purple and jewels and fine linen that she may hide the pallid macerated body that is worn by the suffering that she seeks for and wounded by self-inflicted pain. He possessed a gorgeous cope of crimson silk and gold-thread damask, figured with a repeating pattern of golden pomegranates set in six-petalled formal blossoms, beyond which on either side was the pine-apple device wrought in seed-pearls. The orphreys were divided into panels representing scenes from the life of the Virgin, and the coronation of the Virgin was figured in coloured silks upon the hood. This was Italian work of the fifteenth century.  Another cope was of green velvet, embroidered with heart-shaped groups of acanthus-leaves, from which spread long-stemmed white blossoms, the details of which were picked out with silver thread and coloured crystals.  The morse bore a seraph's head in gold-thread raised work.  The orphreys were woven in a diaper of red and gold silk, and were starred with medallions of many saints and martyrs, among whom was St. Sebastian. He had chasubles, also, of amber-coloured silk, and blue silk and gold brocade, and yellow silk damask and cloth of gold, figured with representations of the Passion and Crucifixion of Christ, and embroidered with lions and peacocks and other emblems; dalmatics of white satin and pink silk damask, decorated with tulips and dolphins and _fleurs-de-lis_; altar frontals of crimson velvet and blue linen; and many corporals, chalice-veils, and sudaria.  In the mystic offices to which such things were put, there was something that quickened his imagination.  For these treasures, and everything that he collected in his lovely house, were to be to him means of forgetfulness, modes by which he could escape, for a season, from the fear that seemed to him at times to be almost too great to be borne.  Upon the walls of the lonely locked room where he had spent so much of his boyhood, he had hung with his own hands the terrible portrait whose changing features showed him the real degradation of his life, and in front of it had draped the purple-and-gold pall as a curtain.  For weeks he would not go there, would forget the hideous painted thing, and get back his light heart, his wonderful joyousness, his passionate absorption in mere existence. Then, suddenly, some night he would creep out of the house, go down to dreadful places near Blue Gate Fields, and stay there, day after day, until he was driven away.  On his return he would sit in front of the picture, sometimes loathing it and himself, but filled, at other times, with that pride of individualism that is half the fascination of sin, and smiling with secret pleasure at the misshapen shadow that had to bear the burden that should have been his own.  After a few years he could not endure to be long out of England, and gave up the villa that he had shared at Trouville with Lord Henry, as well as the little white walled-in house at Algiers where they had more than once spent the winter.  He hated to be separated from the picture that was such a part of his life, and was also afraid that during his absence some one might gain access to the room, in spite of the elaborate bars that he had caused to be placed upon the door.  He was quite conscious that this would tell them nothing.  It was true that the portrait still preserved, under all the foulness and ugliness of the face, its marked likeness to himself; but what could they learn from that?  He would laugh at any one who tried to taunt him.  He had not painted it.  What was it to him how vile and full of shame it looked?  Even if he told them, would they believe it?  Yet he was afraid.  Sometimes when he was down at his great house in Nottinghamshire, entertaining the fashionable young men of his own rank who were his chief companions, and astounding the county by the wanton luxury and gorgeous splendour of his mode of life, he would suddenly leave his guests and rush back to town to see that the door had not been tampered with and that the picture was still there.  What if it should be stolen?  The mere thought made him cold with horror.  Surely the world would know his secret then.  Perhaps the world already suspected it.  For, while he fascinated many, there were not a few who distrusted him. He was very nearly blackballed at a West End club of which his birth and social position fully entitled him to become a member, and it was said that on one occasion, when he was brought by a friend into the smoking-room of the Churchill, the Duke of Berwick and another gentleman got up in a marked manner and went out.  Curious stories became current about him after he had passed his twenty-fifth year.  It was rumoured that he had been seen brawling with foreign sailors in a low den in the distant parts of Whitechapel, and that he consorted with thieves and coiners and knew the mysteries of their trade.  His extraordinary absences became notorious, and, when he used to reappear again in society, men would whisper to each other in corners, or pass him with a sneer, or look at him with cold searching eyes, as though they were determined to discover his secret.  Of such insolences and attempted slights he, of course, took no notice, and in the opinion of most people his frank debonair manner, his charming boyish smile, and the infinite grace of that wonderful youth that seemed never to leave him, were in themselves a sufficient answer to the calumnies, for so they termed them, that were circulated about him.  It was remarked, however, that some of those who had been most intimate with him appeared, after a time, to shun him.  Women who had wildly adored him, and for his sake had braved all social censure and set convention at defiance, were seen to grow pallid with shame or horror if Dorian Gray entered the room.  Yet these whispered scandals only increased in the eyes of many his strange and dangerous charm.  His great wealth was a certain element of security.  Society--civilized society, at least--is never very ready to believe anything to the detriment of those who are both rich and fascinating.  It feels instinctively that manners are of more importance than morals, and, in its opinion, the highest respectability is of much less value than the possession of a good _chef_.  And, after all, it is a very poor consolation to be told that the man who has given one a bad dinner, or poor wine, is irreproachable in his private life.  Even the cardinal virtues cannot atone for half-cold _entrees_, as Lord Henry remarked once, in a discussion on the subject, and there is possibly a good deal to be said for his view.  For the canons of good society are, or should be, the same as the canons of art.  Form is absolutely essential to it.  It should have the dignity of a ceremony, as well as its unreality, and should combine the insincere character of a romantic play with the wit and beauty that make such plays delightful to us.  Is insincerity such a terrible thing?  I think not.  It is merely a method by which we can multiply our personalities.  Such, at any rate, was Dorian Gray's opinion.  He used to wonder at the shallow psychology of those who conceive the ego in man as a thing simple, permanent, reliable, and of one essence.  To him, man was a being with myriad lives and myriad sensations, a complex multiform creature that bore within itself strange legacies of thought and passion, and whose very flesh was tainted with the monstrous maladies of the dead.  He loved to stroll through the gaunt cold picture-gallery of his country house and look at the various portraits of those whose blood flowed in his veins.  Here was Philip Herbert, described by Francis Osborne, in his Memoires on the Reigns of Queen Elizabeth and King James, as one who was \"caressed by the Court for his handsome face, which kept him not long company.\"  Was it young Herbert's life that he sometimes led?  Had some strange poisonous germ crept from body to body till it had reached his own?  Was it some dim sense of that ruined grace that had made him so suddenly, and almost without cause, give utterance, in Basil Hallward's studio, to the mad prayer that had so changed his life?  Here, in gold-embroidered red doublet, jewelled surcoat, and gilt-edged ruff and wristbands, stood Sir Anthony Sherard, with his silver-and-black armour piled at his feet.  What had this man's legacy been?  Had the lover of Giovanna of Naples bequeathed him some inheritance of sin and shame?  Were his own actions merely the dreams that the dead man had not dared to realize?  Here, from the fading canvas, smiled Lady Elizabeth Devereux, in her gauze hood, pearl stomacher, and pink slashed sleeves.  A flower was in her right hand, and her left clasped an enamelled collar of white and damask roses.  On a table by her side lay a mandolin and an apple.  There were large green rosettes upon her little pointed shoes.  He knew her life, and the strange stories that were told about her lovers.  Had he something of her temperament in him?  These oval, heavy-lidded eyes seemed to look curiously at him.  What of George Willoughby, with his powdered hair and fantastic patches?  How evil he looked!  The face was saturnine and swarthy, and the sensual lips seemed to be twisted with disdain.  Delicate lace ruffles fell over the lean yellow hands that were so overladen with rings.  He had been a macaroni of the eighteenth century, and the friend, in his youth, of Lord Ferrars.  What of the second Lord Beckenham, the companion of the Prince Regent in his wildest days, and one of the witnesses at the secret marriage with Mrs. Fitzherbert?  How proud and handsome he was, with his chestnut curls and insolent pose!  What passions had he bequeathed?  The world had looked upon him as infamous.  He had led the orgies at Carlton House. The star of the Garter glittered upon his breast.  Beside him hung the portrait of his wife, a pallid, thin-lipped woman in black.  Her blood, also, stirred within him.  How curious it all seemed!  And his mother with her Lady Hamilton face and her moist, wine-dashed lips--he knew what he had got from her.  He had got from her his beauty, and his passion for the beauty of others.  She laughed at him in her loose Bacchante dress.  There were vine leaves in her hair.  The purple spilled from the cup she was holding.  The carnations of the painting had withered, but the eyes were still wonderful in their depth and brilliancy of colour.  They seemed to follow him wherever he went.  Yet one had ancestors in literature as well as in one's own race, nearer perhaps in type and temperament, many of them, and certainly with an influence of which one was more absolutely conscious.  There were times when it appeared to Dorian Gray that the whole of history was merely the record of his own life, not as he had lived it in act and circumstance, but as his imagination had created it for him, as it had been in his brain and in his passions.  He felt that he had known them all, those strange terrible figures that had passed across the stage of the world and made sin so marvellous and evil so full of subtlety.  It seemed to him that in some mysterious way their lives had been his own.  The hero of the wonderful novel that had so influenced his life had himself known this curious fancy.  In the seventh chapter he tells how, crowned with laurel, lest lightning might strike him, he had sat, as Tiberius, in a garden at Capri, reading the shameful books of Elephantis, while dwarfs and peacocks strutted round him and the flute-player mocked the swinger of the censer; and, as Caligula, had caroused with the green-shirted jockeys in their stables and supped in an ivory manger with a jewel-frontleted horse; and, as Domitian, had wandered through a corridor lined with marble mirrors, looking round with haggard eyes for the reflection of the dagger that was to end his days, and sick with that ennui, that terrible _taedium vitae_, that comes on those to whom life denies nothing; and had peered through a clear emerald at the red shambles of the circus and then, in a litter of pearl and purple drawn by silver-shod mules, been carried through the Street of Pomegranates to a House of Gold and heard men cry on Nero Caesar as he passed by; and, as Elagabalus, had painted his face with colours, and plied the distaff among the women, and brought the Moon from Carthage and given her in mystic marriage to the Sun.  Over and over again Dorian used to read this fantastic chapter, and the two chapters immediately following, in which, as in some curious tapestries or cunningly wrought enamels, were pictured the awful and beautiful forms of those whom vice and blood and weariness had made monstrous or mad:  Filippo, Duke of Milan, who slew his wife and painted her lips with a scarlet poison that her lover might suck death from the dead thing he fondled; Pietro Barbi, the Venetian, known as Paul the Second, who sought in his vanity to assume the title of Formosus, and whose tiara, valued at two hundred thousand florins, was bought at the price of a terrible sin; Gian Maria Visconti, who used hounds to chase living men and whose murdered body was covered with roses by a harlot who had loved him; the Borgia on his white horse, with Fratricide riding beside him and his mantle stained with the blood of Perotto; Pietro Riario, the young Cardinal Archbishop of Florence, child and minion of Sixtus IV, whose beauty was equalled only by his debauchery, and who received Leonora of Aragon in a pavilion of white and crimson silk, filled with nymphs and centaurs, and gilded a boy that he might serve at the feast as Ganymede or Hylas; Ezzelin, whose melancholy could be cured only by the spectacle of death, and who had a passion for red blood, as other men have for red wine--the son of the Fiend, as was reported, and one who had cheated his father at dice when gambling with him for his own soul; Giambattista Cibo, who in mockery took the name of Innocent and into whose torpid veins the blood of three lads was infused by a Jewish doctor; Sigismondo Malatesta, the lover of Isotta and the lord of Rimini, whose effigy was burned at Rome as the enemy of God and man, who strangled Polyssena with a napkin, and gave poison to Ginevra d'Este in a cup of emerald, and in honour of a shameful passion built a pagan church for Christian worship; Charles VI, who had so wildly adored his brother's wife that a leper had warned him of the insanity that was coming on him, and who, when his brain had sickened and grown strange, could only be soothed by Saracen cards painted with the images of love and death and madness; and, in his trimmed jerkin and jewelled cap and acanthuslike curls, Grifonetto Baglioni, who slew Astorre with his bride, and Simonetto with his page, and whose comeliness was such that, as he lay dying in the yellow piazza of Perugia, those who had hated him could not choose but weep, and Atalanta, who had cursed him, blessed him.  There was a horrible fascination in them all.  He saw them at night, and they troubled his imagination in the day.  The Renaissance knew of strange manners of poisoning--poisoning by a helmet and a lighted torch, by an embroidered glove and a jewelled fan, by a gilded pomander and by an amber chain.  Dorian Gray had been poisoned by a book.  There were moments when he looked on evil simply as a mode through which he could realize his conception of the beautiful.\n",

      "\"Mother, Mother, I am so happy!\" whispered the girl, burying her face in the lap of the faded, tired-looking woman who, with back turned to the shrill intrusive light, was sitting in the one arm-chair that their dingy sitting-room contained.  \"I am so happy!\" she repeated, \"and you must be happy, too!\"  Mrs. Vane winced and put her thin, bismuth-whitened hands on her daughter's head.  \"Happy!\" she echoed, \"I am only happy, Sibyl, when I see you act.  You must not think of anything but your acting.  Mr. Isaacs has been very good to us, and we owe him money.\"  The girl looked up and pouted.  \"Money, Mother?\" she cried, \"what does money matter?  Love is more than money.\"  \"Mr. Isaacs has advanced us fifty pounds to pay off our debts and to get a proper outfit for James.  You must not forget that, Sibyl.  Fifty pounds is a very large sum.  Mr. Isaacs has been most considerate.\"  \"He is not a gentleman, Mother, and I hate the way he talks to me,\" said the girl, rising to her feet and going over to the window.  \"I don't know how we could manage without him,\" answered the elder woman querulously.  Sibyl Vane tossed her head and laughed.  \"We don't want him any more, Mother.  Prince Charming rules life for us now.\" Then she paused.  A rose shook in her blood and shadowed her cheeks.  Quick breath parted the petals of her lips.  They trembled.  Some southern wind of passion swept over her and stirred the dainty folds of her dress.  \"I love him,\" she said simply.  \"Foolish child! foolish child!\" was the parrot-phrase flung in answer. The waving of crooked, false-jewelled fingers gave grotesqueness to the words.  The girl laughed again.  The joy of a caged bird was in her voice.  Her eyes caught the melody and echoed it in radiance, then closed for a moment, as though to hide their secret.  When they opened, the mist of a dream had passed across them.  Thin-lipped wisdom spoke at her from the worn chair, hinted at prudence, quoted from that book of cowardice whose author apes the name of common sense.  She did not listen.  She was free in her prison of passion.  Her prince, Prince Charming, was with her.  She had called on memory to remake him.  She had sent her soul to search for him, and it had brought him back.  His kiss burned again upon her mouth.  Her eyelids were warm with his breath.  Then wisdom altered its method and spoke of espial and discovery.  This young man might be rich.  If so, marriage should be thought of. Against the shell of her ear broke the waves of worldly cunning.  The arrows of craft shot by her.  She saw the thin lips moving, and smiled.  Suddenly she felt the need to speak.  The wordy silence troubled her. \"Mother, Mother,\" she cried, \"why does he love me so much?  I know why I love him.  I love him because he is like what love himself should be. But what does he see in me?  I am not worthy of him.  And yet--why, I cannot tell--though I feel so much beneath him, I don't feel humble.  I feel proud, terribly proud.  Mother, did you love my father as I love Prince Charming?\"  The elder woman grew pale beneath the coarse powder that daubed her cheeks, and her dry lips twitched with a spasm of pain.  Sybil rushed to her, flung her arms round her neck, and kissed her.  \"Forgive me, Mother.  I know it pains you to talk about our father.  But it only pains you because you loved him so much.  Don't look so sad.  I am as happy to-day as you were twenty years ago.  Ah! let me be happy for ever!\"  \"My child, you are far too young to think of falling in love.  Besides, what do you know of this young man?  You don't even know his name.  The whole thing is most inconvenient, and really, when James is going away to Australia, and I have so much to think of, I must say that you should have shown more consideration.  However, as I said before, if he is rich ...\"  \"Ah!  Mother, Mother, let me be happy!\"  Mrs. Vane glanced at her, and with one of those false theatrical gestures that so often become a mode of second nature to a stage-player, clasped her in her arms.  At this moment, the door opened and a young lad with rough brown hair came into the room.  He was thick-set of figure, and his hands and feet were large and somewhat clumsy in movement.  He was not so finely bred as his sister.  One would hardly have guessed the close relationship that existed between them.  Mrs. Vane fixed her eyes on him and intensified her smile.  She mentally elevated her son to the dignity of an audience.  She felt sure that the _tableau_ was interesting.  \"You might keep some of your kisses for me, Sibyl, I think,\" said the lad with a good-natured grumble.  \"Ah! but you don't like being kissed, Jim,\" she cried.  \"You are a dreadful old bear.\"  And she ran across the room and hugged him.  James Vane looked into his sister's face with tenderness.  \"I want you to come out with me for a walk, Sibyl.  I don't suppose I shall ever see this horrid London again.  I am sure I don't want to.\"  \"My son, don't say such dreadful things,\" murmured Mrs. Vane, taking up a tawdry theatrical dress, with a sigh, and beginning to patch it.  She felt a little disappointed that he had not joined the group.  It would have increased the theatrical picturesqueness of the situation.  \"Why not, Mother?  I mean it.\"  \"You pain me, my son.  I trust you will return from Australia in a position of affluence.  I believe there is no society of any kind in the Colonies--nothing that I would call society--so when you have made your fortune, you must come back and assert yourself in London.\"  \"Society!\" muttered the lad.  \"I don't want to know anything about that.  I should like to make some money to take you and Sibyl off the stage.  I hate it.\"  \"Oh, Jim!\" said Sibyl, laughing, \"how unkind of you!  But are you really going for a walk with me?  That will be nice!  I was afraid you were going to say good-bye to some of your friends--to Tom Hardy, who gave you that hideous pipe, or Ned Langton, who makes fun of you for smoking it.  It is very sweet of you to let me have your last afternoon.  Where shall we go?  Let us go to the park.\"  \"I am too shabby,\" he answered, frowning.  \"Only swell people go to the park.\"  \"Nonsense, Jim,\" she whispered, stroking the sleeve of his coat.  He hesitated for a moment.  \"Very well,\" he said at last, \"but don't be too long dressing.\"  She danced out of the door.  One could hear her singing as she ran upstairs.  Her little feet pattered overhead.  He walked up and down the room two or three times.  Then he turned to the still figure in the chair.  \"Mother, are my things ready?\" he asked.  \"Quite ready, James,\" she answered, keeping her eyes on her work.  For some months past she had felt ill at ease when she was alone with this rough stern son of hers.  Her shallow secret nature was troubled when their eyes met.  She used to wonder if he suspected anything.  The silence, for he made no other observation, became intolerable to her. She began to complain.  Women defend themselves by attacking, just as they attack by sudden and strange surrenders.  \"I hope you will be contented, James, with your sea-faring life,\" she said.  \"You must remember that it is your own choice.  You might have entered a solicitor's office.  Solicitors are a very respectable class, and in the country often dine with the best families.\"  \"I hate offices, and I hate clerks,\" he replied.  \"But you are quite right.  I have chosen my own life.  All I say is, watch over Sibyl. Don't let her come to any harm.  Mother, you must watch over her.\"  \"James, you really talk very strangely.  Of course I watch over Sibyl.\"  \"I hear a gentleman comes every night to the theatre and goes behind to talk to her.  Is that right?  What about that?\"  \"You are speaking about things you don't understand, James.  In the profession we are accustomed to receive a great deal of most gratifying attention.  I myself used to receive many bouquets at one time.  That was when acting was really understood.  As for Sibyl, I do not know at present whether her attachment is serious or not.  But there is no doubt that the young man in question is a perfect gentleman.  He is always most polite to me.  Besides, he has the appearance of being rich, and the flowers he sends are lovely.\"  \"You don't know his name, though,\" said the lad harshly.  \"No,\" answered his mother with a placid expression in her face.  \"He has not yet revealed his real name.  I think it is quite romantic of him.  He is probably a member of the aristocracy.\"  James Vane bit his lip.  \"Watch over Sibyl, Mother,\" he cried, \"watch over her.\"  \"My son, you distress me very much.  Sibyl is always under my special care.  Of course, if this gentleman is wealthy, there is no reason why she should not contract an alliance with him.  I trust he is one of the aristocracy.  He has all the appearance of it, I must say.  It might be a most brilliant marriage for Sibyl.  They would make a charming couple.  His good looks are really quite remarkable; everybody notices them.\"  The lad muttered something to himself and drummed on the window-pane with his coarse fingers.  He had just turned round to say something when the door opened and Sibyl ran in.  \"How serious you both are!\" she cried.  \"What is the matter?\"  \"Nothing,\" he answered.  \"I suppose one must be serious sometimes. Good-bye, Mother; I will have my dinner at five o'clock. Everything is packed, except my shirts, so you need not trouble.\"  \"Good-bye, my son,\" she answered with a bow of strained stateliness.  She was extremely annoyed at the tone he had adopted with her, and there was something in his look that had made her feel afraid.  \"Kiss me, Mother,\" said the girl.  Her flowerlike lips touched the withered cheek and warmed its frost.  \"My child! my child!\" cried Mrs. Vane, looking up to the ceiling in search of an imaginary gallery.  \"Come, Sibyl,\" said her brother impatiently.  He hated his mother's affectations.  They went out into the flickering, wind-blown sunlight and strolled down the dreary Euston Road.  The passersby glanced in wonder at the sullen heavy youth who, in coarse, ill-fitting clothes, was in the company of such a graceful, refined-looking girl.  He was like a common gardener walking with a rose.  Jim frowned from time to time when he caught the inquisitive glance of some stranger.  He had that dislike of being stared at, which comes on geniuses late in life and never leaves the commonplace.  Sibyl, however, was quite unconscious of the effect she was producing.  Her love was trembling in laughter on her lips.  She was thinking of Prince Charming, and, that she might think of him all the more, she did not talk of him, but prattled on about the ship in which Jim was going to sail, about the gold he was certain to find, about the wonderful heiress whose life he was to save from the wicked, red-shirted bushrangers.  For he was not to remain a sailor, or a supercargo, or whatever he was going to be.  Oh, no!  A sailor's existence was dreadful.  Fancy being cooped up in a horrid ship, with the hoarse, hump-backed waves trying to get in, and a black wind blowing the masts down and tearing the sails into long screaming ribands!  He was to leave the vessel at Melbourne, bid a polite good-bye to the captain, and go off at once to the gold-fields. Before a week was over he was to come across a large nugget of pure gold, the largest nugget that had ever been discovered, and bring it down to the coast in a waggon guarded by six mounted policemen.  The bushrangers were to attack them three times, and be defeated with immense slaughter.  Or, no.  He was not to go to the gold-fields at all.  They were horrid places, where men got intoxicated, and shot each other in bar-rooms, and used bad language.  He was to be a nice sheep-farmer, and one evening, as he was riding home, he was to see the beautiful heiress being carried off by a robber on a black horse, and give chase, and rescue her.  Of course, she would fall in love with him, and he with her, and they would get married, and come home, and live in an immense house in London.  Yes, there were delightful things in store for him.  But he must be very good, and not lose his temper, or spend his money foolishly.  She was only a year older than he was, but she knew so much more of life.  He must be sure, also, to write to her by every mail, and to say his prayers each night before he went to sleep.  God was very good, and would watch over him.  She would pray for him, too, and in a few years he would come back quite rich and happy.  The lad listened sulkily to her and made no answer.  He was heart-sick at leaving home.  Yet it was not this alone that made him gloomy and morose. Inexperienced though he was, he had still a strong sense of the danger of Sibyl's position.  This young dandy who was making love to her could mean her no good.  He was a gentleman, and he hated him for that, hated him through some curious race-instinct for which he could not account, and which for that reason was all the more dominant within him.  He was conscious also of the shallowness and vanity of his mother's nature, and in that saw infinite peril for Sibyl and Sibyl's happiness. Children begin by loving their parents; as they grow older they judge them; sometimes they forgive them.  His mother!  He had something on his mind to ask of her, something that he had brooded on for many months of silence.  A chance phrase that he had heard at the theatre, a whispered sneer that had reached his ears one night as he waited at the stage-door, had set loose a train of horrible thoughts.  He remembered it as if it had been the lash of a hunting-crop across his face.  His brows knit together into a wedge-like furrow, and with a twitch of pain he bit his underlip.  \"You are not listening to a word I am saying, Jim,\" cried Sibyl, \"and I am making the most delightful plans for your future.  Do say something.\"  \"What do you want me to say?\"  \"Oh! that you will be a good boy and not forget us,\" she answered, smiling at him.  He shrugged his shoulders.  \"You are more likely to forget me than I am to forget you, Sibyl.\"  She flushed.  \"What do you mean, Jim?\" she asked.  \"You have a new friend, I hear.  Who is he?  Why have you not told me about him?  He means you no good.\"  \"Stop, Jim!\" she exclaimed.  \"You must not say anything against him.  I love him.\"  \"Why, you don't even know his name,\" answered the lad.  \"Who is he?  I have a right to know.\"  \"He is called Prince Charming.  Don't you like the name.  Oh! you silly boy! you should never forget it.  If you only saw him, you would think him the most wonderful person in the world.  Some day you will meet him--when you come back from Australia.  You will like him so much. Everybody likes him, and I ... love him.  I wish you could come to the theatre to-night. He is going to be there, and I am to play Juliet. Oh! how I shall play it!  Fancy, Jim, to be in love and play Juliet! To have him sitting there!  To play for his delight!  I am afraid I may frighten the company, frighten or enthrall them.  To be in love is to surpass one's self.  Poor dreadful Mr. Isaacs will be shouting 'genius' to his loafers at the bar.  He has preached me as a dogma; to-night he will announce me as a revelation.  I feel it.  And it is all his, his only, Prince Charming, my wonderful lover, my god of graces.  But I am poor beside him.  Poor?  What does that matter?  When poverty creeps in at the door, love flies in through the window.  Our proverbs want rewriting.  They were made in winter, and it is summer now; spring-time for me, I think, a very dance of blossoms in blue skies.\"  \"He is a gentleman,\" said the lad sullenly.  \"A prince!\" she cried musically.  \"What more do you want?\"  \"He wants to enslave you.\"  \"I shudder at the thought of being free.\"  \"I want you to beware of him.\"  \"To see him is to worship him; to know him is to trust him.\"  \"Sibyl, you are mad about him.\"  She laughed and took his arm.  \"You dear old Jim, you talk as if you were a hundred.  Some day you will be in love yourself.  Then you will know what it is.  Don't look so sulky.  Surely you should be glad to think that, though you are going away, you leave me happier than I have ever been before.  Life has been hard for us both, terribly hard and difficult.  But it will be different now.  You are going to a new world, and I have found one.  Here are two chairs; let us sit down and see the smart people go by.\"  They took their seats amidst a crowd of watchers.  The tulip-beds across the road flamed like throbbing rings of fire.  A white dust--tremulous cloud of orris-root it seemed--hung in the panting air. The brightly coloured parasols danced and dipped like monstrous butterflies.  She made her brother talk of himself, his hopes, his prospects.  He spoke slowly and with effort.  They passed words to each other as players at a game pass counters.  Sibyl felt oppressed.  She could not communicate her joy.  A faint smile curving that sullen mouth was all the echo she could win.  After some time she became silent.  Suddenly she caught a glimpse of golden hair and laughing lips, and in an open carriage with two ladies Dorian Gray drove past.  She started to her feet.  \"There he is!\" she cried.  \"Who?\" said Jim Vane.  \"Prince Charming,\" she answered, looking after the victoria.  He jumped up and seized her roughly by the arm.  \"Show him to me. Which is he?  Point him out.  I must see him!\" he exclaimed; but at that moment the Duke of Berwick's four-in-hand came between, and when it had left the space clear, the carriage had swept out of the park.  \"He is gone,\" murmured Sibyl sadly.  \"I wish you had seen him.\"  \"I wish I had, for as sure as there is a God in heaven, if he ever does you any wrong, I shall kill him.\"  She looked at him in horror.  He repeated his words.  They cut the air like a dagger.  The people round began to gape.  A lady standing close to her tittered.  \"Come away, Jim; come away,\" she whispered.  He followed her doggedly as she passed through the crowd.  He felt glad at what he had said.  When they reached the Achilles Statue, she turned round.  There was pity in her eyes that became laughter on her lips.  She shook her head at him.  \"You are foolish, Jim, utterly foolish; a bad-tempered boy, that is all.  How can you say such horrible things?  You don't know what you are talking about.  You are simply jealous and unkind.  Ah!  I wish you would fall in love.  Love makes people good, and what you said was wicked.\"  \"I am sixteen,\" he answered, \"and I know what I am about.  Mother is no help to you.  She doesn't understand how to look after you.  I wish now that I was not going to Australia at all.  I have a great mind to chuck the whole thing up.  I would, if my articles hadn't been signed.\"  \"Oh, don't be so serious, Jim.  You are like one of the heroes of those silly melodramas Mother used to be so fond of acting in.  I am not going to quarrel with you.  I have seen him, and oh! to see him is perfect happiness.  We won't quarrel.  I know you would never harm any one I love, would you?\"  \"Not as long as you love him, I suppose,\" was the sullen answer.  \"I shall love him for ever!\" she cried.  \"And he?\"  \"For ever, too!\"  \"He had better.\"  She shrank from him.  Then she laughed and put her hand on his arm.  He was merely a boy.  At the Marble Arch they hailed an omnibus, which left them close to their shabby home in the Euston Road.  It was after five o'clock, and Sibyl had to lie down for a couple of hours before acting.  Jim insisted that she should do so.  He said that he would sooner part with her when their mother was not present.  She would be sure to make a scene, and he detested scenes of every kind.  In Sybil's own room they parted.  There was jealousy in the lad's heart, and a fierce murderous hatred of the stranger who, as it seemed to him, had come between them.  Yet, when her arms were flung round his neck, and her fingers strayed through his hair, he softened and kissed her with real affection.  There were tears in his eyes as he went downstairs.  His mother was waiting for him below.  She grumbled at his unpunctuality, as he entered.  He made no answer, but sat down to his meagre meal.  The flies buzzed round the table and crawled over the stained cloth.  Through the rumble of omnibuses, and the clatter of street-cabs, he could hear the droning voice devouring each minute that was left to him.  After some time, he thrust away his plate and put his head in his hands.  He felt that he had a right to know.  It should have been told to him before, if it was as he suspected.  Leaden with fear, his mother watched him.  Words dropped mechanically from her lips.  A tattered lace handkerchief twitched in her fingers.  When the clock struck six, he got up and went to the door.  Then he turned back and looked at her. Their eyes met.  In hers he saw a wild appeal for mercy.  It enraged him.  \"Mother, I have something to ask you,\" he said.  Her eyes wandered vaguely about the room.  She made no answer.  \"Tell me the truth.  I have a right to know.  Were you married to my father?\"  She heaved a deep sigh.  It was a sigh of relief.  The terrible moment, the moment that night and day, for weeks and months, she had dreaded, had come at last, and yet she felt no terror.  Indeed, in some measure it was a disappointment to her.  The vulgar directness of the question called for a direct answer.  The situation had not been gradually led up to.  It was crude.  It reminded her of a bad rehearsal.  \"No,\" she answered, wondering at the harsh simplicity of life.  \"My father was a scoundrel then!\" cried the lad, clenching his fists.  She shook her head.  \"I knew he was not free.  We loved each other very much.  If he had lived, he would have made provision for us.  Don't speak against him, my son.  He was your father, and a gentleman. Indeed, he was highly connected.\"  An oath broke from his lips.  \"I don't care for myself,\" he exclaimed, \"but don't let Sibyl.... It is a gentleman, isn't it, who is in love with her, or says he is?  Highly connected, too, I suppose.\"  For a moment a hideous sense of humiliation came over the woman.  Her head drooped.  She wiped her eyes with shaking hands.  \"Sibyl has a mother,\" she murmured; \"I had none.\"  The lad was touched.  He went towards her, and stooping down, he kissed her.  \"I am sorry if I have pained you by asking about my father,\" he said, \"but I could not help it.  I must go now.  Good-bye. Don't forget that you will have only one child now to look after, and believe me that if this man wrongs my sister, I will find out who he is, track him down, and kill him like a dog.  I swear it.\"  The exaggerated folly of the threat, the passionate gesture that accompanied it, the mad melodramatic words, made life seem more vivid to her.  She was familiar with the atmosphere.  She breathed more freely, and for the first time for many months she really admired her son.  She would have liked to have continued the scene on the same emotional scale, but he cut her short.  Trunks had to be carried down and mufflers looked for.  The lodging-house drudge bustled in and out. There was the bargaining with the cabman.  The moment was lost in vulgar details.  It was with a renewed feeling of disappointment that she waved the tattered lace handkerchief from the window, as her son drove away.  She was conscious that a great opportunity had been wasted.  She consoled herself by telling Sibyl how desolate she felt her life would be, now that she had only one child to look after.  She remembered the phrase.  It had pleased her.  Of the threat she said nothing.  It was vividly and dramatically expressed.  She felt that they would all laugh at it some day.\n",
